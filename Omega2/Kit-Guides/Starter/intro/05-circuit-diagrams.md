## Circuit Diagram Introduction

// intro:
//	* most if not all of our experiments will use circuit diagrams to describe the circuits we will be building
// 	* use this as a reference when reading the circuit diagrams

// circuit diagrams can also be referred to as schematics or circuit schematics

Nearly all of our experiments will use a circuit diagram to precisely express the circuit that will be built. We use them as an additional way to check progress and reference the corrections

### General Structure

// show an example circuit diagram, briefly cover the following:
//	* the lines mean connections
//	* the various symbols mean different components
//		* the components are usually labelled with values




////
// Listing of components used in this Kit,
// should look something like this: https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/how-to-read-a-schematic/schematic-symbols-part-1
 
// each component should have a section that shows:
//	* the name of the component
//	* the symbol
//	* a brief description that includes:
//		* how many terminals it has
//		* if there are any values associated with the diagram, explain what it means
//		* a photo of the real component


// NOTE FROM LAZAR: only include symbols for components included in this kit, can use separate files for each component,
// see `Omega2/Kit-Guides/shared/circuit-components/resistor.md` for an example
// lets put all of the components in that directory, `Omega2/Kit-Guides/shared/circuit-components/`

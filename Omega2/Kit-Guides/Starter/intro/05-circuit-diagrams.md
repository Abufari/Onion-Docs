// Listing of components used in this Kit,
// should look something like this: https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/how-to-read-a-schematic/schematic-symbols-part-1

// each component should have a section that shows:
//	* the name of the component
//	* the symbol
//	* a brief description that includes:
//		* how many terminals it has
//		* if there are any values associated with the diagram, explain what it means
//		* a photo of the real component

<!-- // NOTE FROM LAZAR: only include symbols for components included in this kit, can use separate files for each component,
// see `Omega2/Kit-Guides/shared/circuit-components/resistor.md` for an example
// lets put all of the components in that directory, `Omega2/Kit-Guides/shared/circuit-components/`

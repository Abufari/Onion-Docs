## Creating and Writing to Files

// this article is a description of how we're going to use `vi` to write the code we need for the experiments

// intro to article:
//	* the experiments we're going to do involve writing Python scripts
//	* here we'll learn how to write scripts using the command line
//	* we'll be using the Vi text editor

### Creating or Opening a File

// `vi <filename>`
// if the file doesn't exist, will create it
// if the file already exists, will open it

### Writing Text

// process: Have to hit `i` to be able to instert text, even before copy pasting

### Saving changes

// process: `:w` to save changes

### Quitting and Saving changes

// process: `:wq` to save changes and exit vi

### Quitting without Saving Changes

// process: `:q!` to quit without saving changes

// NOTES FROM LAZAR:
// * the above outlines are brief but the article should be enough for an absolute beginner to get started with Vi
// * use this as a reference: https://docs.onion.io/omega2-docs/developing-using-the-command-line.html
// * include screenshots if you think it will help get the point across

### More on Vi

// 'this is a brief intro to vi, it's actually a super powerful editor, learn more wiht this tutorial'
// TODO: find a really good Vi tutorial

## Intro to Python

// brief intro:
//	* all of the experiments in this kit will use Python
// 	* python is a high-level, object oriented programming language
//	* it is an interpreted programming language, meaning the code doesn't have to be compiled (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpreted_language for details but DON'T JUST RIP IT OFF)

### How we'll use Python

// * this guide will provide complete python scripts which can be copied to your Omega and executed. each experiment will describe the script and will focus on interesting parts of the code

### Python Syntax Overview

// give an example blocks of code to describe the following concepts:
//	* indentation syntax for if, for, while statements
//		* describe which is the statement and which is the body, can be accomplished with a screenshot with some writing over-top
//	* indentation syntax for functions
//		* same as above
//	* comments in the code

### Learning More about Python

// * there is a wealth of tutorials and guides on Python online, if you're unsure of how or why we did something, consult the following resources:
//	* programmers guide for getting started with Python: https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Programmers
//	* beginners guide for getting started with python: https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/NonProgrammers

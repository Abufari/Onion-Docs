## Intro to Python

<!--
// brief intro:
//	* all of the experiments in this kit will use Python
// 	* python is a high-level, object oriented programming language
//	* it is an interpreted programming language, meaning the code doesn't have to be compiled (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpreted_language for details but DON'T JUST RIP IT OFF)
-->

Python is the language of choice for the experiments we'll be running with the Kits. As an introduction, this article will cover some of the basics so we can hit the ground running!

Python is a high-level, interpreted language designed for scripting. It supports Object Oriented Programming - which is a handy framework that we'll be covering in our experiments.

The high-level part means that Python reads closer to English than machine language. The interpreted part means that Python code is translated line-by-line by the computer as it's being run - as opposed to languages like C where it is translated first before it can be run.

### How we'll use Python

<!-- // * this guide will provide complete python scripts which can be copied to your Omega and executed. each experiment will describe the script and will focus on interesting parts of the code -->

The experiments will provide code that works out of the box that can be directly copied to the Omega and run. We'll also discuss more interesting sections of the code in detail. The code provided generally won't be 'absolutely perfect' so there's plenty of room to experiment and customize to fit your own projects!


### Python Syntax Overview

// give an example blocks of code to describe the following concepts:
//	* indentation syntax for if, for, while statements
//		* describe which is the statement and which is the body, can be accomplished with a screenshot with some writing over-top
//	* indentation syntax for functions
//		* same as above
//	* comments in the code

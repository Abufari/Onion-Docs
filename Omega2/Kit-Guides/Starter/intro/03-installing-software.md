## Installing Software

// intro:
//	* we'll need to install some additional software on the Omega to make sure that all of the code we write for our experiments will work
//	* to do that, we'll use `opkg`, the Omega's package Manager

### What is OPKG?

// brief description of `opkg`
//	* explain the concept of linux package managers and software packages
//	* the omega's package manager is `opkg`,

### Installing the Packages We Need (Maybe better title for this section)

// outline the commands we'll need to run to install the required software:
//	opkg update
//	opkg install <packages>
// -> you'll have to look through the experiments to see which packages we need, sync up with Lazar when you're done

// show the expected output

### Doing More with OPKG

// opkg can do a lot more, link them to the opkg article in our Docs (https://docs.onion.io/omega2-docs/using-opkg.html)

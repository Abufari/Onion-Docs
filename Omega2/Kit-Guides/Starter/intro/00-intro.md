Welcome to the Guide for the Onion Omega2 Starter Kit!

### What we're Going to Learn

// a listing of what this kit will teach the reader
//	* How to put together circuits on a breadboard (essential skill for electronics prototyping)
//	* Get comfortable reading circuit diagrams
//	* Using Python to control external circuits with the Omega
//		* From the ground-up programming
//		* Using existing Python modules
//		* Object Oriented programming
//			* Using classes
//			* Writing our own classes
//	*

### What's Included

// overview of what the Kit contains
// * include the image that was printed with the kits (ask Zheng for this)

### How to use this Guide

// * setup your Omega (link to #first-time-setup)
// * install some of the software packages we'll need for our experiments (link to our software installation article)
// * we recommend working your way linearly through the experiments as they usually build on what we've just learned

### What Exactly Will I Learn?

// * list of the experiments in order (obv with links), give a one-sentence description of each (should contain the main component we're working with and what we're gonna do with it)

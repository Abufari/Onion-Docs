We're going to learn about the following:

* How to put together circuits on a breadboard  
    * This is an essential skill for electronics prototyping!
* Get comfortable reading circuit diagrams
* Using the Omega's command line interface
* Writing Python scripts on the command line
* Using Python to control external circuits with the Omega
	* Programming from the ground-up
	* Learning If statements, For loops, While Loops
	* Writing our own functions
	* Programming existing Python modules
	* Object Oriented programming
		* Using classes
		* Writing our own classes

### What's Included

<!-- DONE: // overview of what the Kit contains
// * include the image that was printed with the kits (ask Zheng for this) -->

Your Starter Kit contains the following items; we've labelled them here for your convenience.

### How to Use This Guide

<!-- // * setup your Omega (link to #first-time-setup)
// * install some of the software packages we'll need for our experiments (link to our software installation article)
// * we recommend working your way linearly through the experiments as they usually build on what we've just learned -->
Before getting started on the experiments, set up your Omega by following the guides below:

1. [First Time Setup](#first-time-setup).
1. [Software Installation](#starter-kit-intro-installing-software)

Once you've done those, we recommend working your way through the experiments in order as they usually build on what we've learned in each one.

### What Exactly Will I Learn?

<!-- // * list of the experiments in order (obv with links), give a one-sentence description of each (should contain the main component we're working with and what we're gonna do with it) -->

Here's a list of all of the experiments we're going to build with your Kit:

1. [Blinking an LED](#starter-kit-blinking-led)
    * Learn the basics of programming the Omega by turning an LED on and off.
1. [Blinking Multiple LEDs](#starter-kit-multiple-leds)
    * Learn some more programming concepts by controlling multiple LEDs at once.
1. [Fading an LED](#starter-kit-fading-led)
    * Create a cool LED fading effect using the pulse width modulation technique.
1. [Reading a Switch](#starter-kit-reading-switch)
    * Use a physical switch to control an LED through the Omega.
1. [Using a Shift Register](#starter-kit-using-shift-register)
    * Use a shift register chip to control 8 LEDs using only a few GPIOs.
1. [Controlling a Seven-Segment Display](#starter-kit-seven-segment-display)
    * Add a seven-segment display to the previous circuit to display numbers.
1. [Reading a 1-Wire Temperature Sensor](#starter-kit-temp-sensor)
    * Use a 1-Wire temperature sensor to read the ambient temperature.
1. [Controlling LCD Screen](#starter-kit-controlling-an-lcd-screen)
    * Use the I2C protocol to control an LCD screen attached to the previous circuit.

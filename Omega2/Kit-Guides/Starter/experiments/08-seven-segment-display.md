## Controlling a 7-Segment Display {#starter-kit-seven-segment-display}

We've just learned about shift registers; now, let's apply that knowledge to control a 7-segment Display so we can display numbers (and a few letters) in the physical world. We'll connect the 7-segment display to the shift register that we wired up last time. We'll write a program to send serial signals to the shift register which will be transformed into numbers and letters on the 7-segment display. We'll then observe the output and see if there's anything interesting we notice.

**Note:** This experiment builds on the previous one, so you should make sure you complete it before moving onto this one!

```{r child = '../../shared/seven-segment.md'}
```

### Building the Circuit

Using the shift register and a few additional GPIOs from the Omega, we will control what's displayed on all four digits of the 7-segment display.

// TODO: spice up this sentence, sounds so boring
// TODO: make sure to point out that we need to use the shift register to make up for the fact we have a limited amount of GPIOs on the Omega

<!-- // TODO: include a block diagram of the system -->

#### What You'll Need

* 1x Omega2 plugged into Expansion Dock
* 1x 7-Segment Display
* 1x Shift Register
* 4x 330Î© Resistors
* Jumpers
    * 12x M-F
    * 13x M-M

#### Hooking up the Components


First things first, we'll be building on our previous experiment. 

* If you've done the previous experiment, keep the shift register wired up just like you had it.
* If you skipped it, [**we strongly recommend you check it out**](#starter-kit-using-shift-register) before moving on to this one!

For quick reference, we've included a wiring diagram between the shift register and the Expansion Dock below.

<!-- TODO: IMAGE diagram of shift register/dock/breadboard wiring -->

> It's important that all components have a common ground (no pun intended). Signals are measured as the **difference** in voltage between the signal pin and ground, so all of the components need to be measuring from the same baseline.

1. Connecting your Shift Register

  - Start by plugging in your shift register across the channel so that the each pin has its own row.
  - Connect pin 16 and pin 10 to the positive rail (Vcc)
  - Connect pin 8 and pin 13 to the negative rail (Ground)

When you have the shift register wired up, it's time to connect it to the 7-segment display. First, we'll have to add current-limiting resistors since the display is a set of multiple LEDs. We recommend you set up the resistors across the center first, and do all the wiring in one go.

1. Connecting the 7-Segment Display

We've included a diagram below for reference instead of instructions, as this one has a lot of wiring to do and they end up going every which way. Note that all ends connecting to the 7-segment display require F jumper heads - that's where your M-F jumpers will be used.

<!-- TODO: IMAGE wiring diagram of 7-seg to shift register and dock -->

Once you've connected the 7-segment display to the Omega and shift register, it's all done! Your circuit should look like this:

<!-- TODO: photo of completed circuit -->

``` {r child = '../../shared/wiring-precautions.md'}
```

### Writing the Code

We'll be developing a program that takes input from command line arguments when it's launched and displays them on the 7-segment display.

<!-- // TODO: include a block diagram of the code and a description of what we're going to be doing from a high level -->

To accomplish this, we will write a new class that uses and builds upon the shift register class from the previous experiment.

<!-- // [notes on the code]
// create a class that uses the shift reg class but specifically to control the 7seg display
//  * the 7seg class has self.shiftReg
//  functions:
//  * setup function to let the object know which gpios correspond to which functionality
//  * writing a single digit (have a dictionary in the 7seg class that maps each hex digit to a binary to be mapped to the segments)
//  * selecting which digit to write to (controls scan pins)
//  * function to write a value to a specific digit (combines the two above functions)
// command line arguments:
//  * make sure to check that a command line argument is present, if not, print an error message and exit the program
//  * input sanitization to ensure they only enter hex numbers (really good practise)
//  * write the sanitized input to the 7seg

-->

Now let's create a class named `sevenSegDisplay.py`.


``` python
import registerClass
import onionGpio
import time

# seven segment class
class SevenSegment:
    # class attribute
    # dictionary mapping each alphanumeric character to the bytestring that should be sent to the shift register
    digitMap = {
    "0": "00111111",
    "1": "00000110",
    "2": "01011011",
    "3": "01001111",
    "4": "01100110",
    "5": "01101101",
    "6": "01111101",
    "7": "00000111",
    "8": "01111111",
    "9": "01101111",
    "a": "01110111",
    "b": "01111100",
    "c": "10011100",
    "d": "01111010",
    "e": "10011110",
    "f": "10001110",
    "off": "00000000",
    "-": "01000000"
    }

	#Initializes the GPIO objects based on the pin numbers
	def __init__(self, dPin):
		self.shiftReg = registerClass.shiftRegister(1,2,3)
        for i in range (0,4):
    		self.digitPin[i] = onionGpio.OnionGpio(dPin[i])
    		self.digitPin[i].setOutputDirection(1)


	def showDigit(self, d, character):
		self.digitPin[d].setValue(0)
		self.shiftReg.outputBits(SevenSegment.digitMap[character])
		self.digitPin[d].setValue(1)


	def clear(self):
		self.shiftReg.clear();
        for i in range (0,4):
    		self.digitPin[i] = onionGpio.OnionGpio(dPin[i])
```

Now that we have a class to control the 7-seg display, let's write our main script! Create a file called `STK07-seven-seg-display.py` and paste the following in it:

``` python
import registerClass
from sevenSegDisplay import SevenSegment
import time
import sys

# instantiate 7-segment object
sevenDisplay = SevenSegment(11,18,19,0)

errorMsgs = {
    "missingArguments": "Please input a hex number, eg. 0x12ab",
    "tooManyArguments": "Too many arguments. Please input only one hex number.",
    "tooShort": "Hex number is too short. Please include 4 digits after the 0x.",
    "tooLong": "Hex number is too long. Please include only 4 digits after the 0x.",
    "notHexNumber": "Input string is not a valid hex number. "
}

def __main__():
    # if script was called with no arguments
    if len(sys.argv) == 1:
        print errorMsgs["missingArguments"]
        return -1

    # if script was called with too many arguments
    elif len(sys.argv) > 2:
        print errorMsgs["tooManyArguments"]
        return -1

    # read the hex string from the argument
    # extract the digits following the 0x
    # convert any uppercase letters to lowercase
    inputHexString = sys.argv[1]
    inputHexString = inputHexString.split("x")[1]
    inputHexString = inputHexString.lower()
    inputLen = len(inputHexString)

    # validate the string's length
    if inputLen < 4:
        print errorMsgs["tooShort"]
        return -1
    elif inputLen > 4:
        print errorMsgs["tooLong"]
        return -1
    
    # check if valid hex digits (09, a-f)
    try:
        int(inputHexString, 16)
    except ValueError:
        print errorMsgs["notHexNumber"]
        return -1

    # attempt to display out the hex string
    while True:
        for i in range(inputLen):
        	sevenDisplay.showDigit(i,inputHexString[i])

# for running from the command line
if __name__ == '__main__':
    __main__()
```

The for loop here is doing something really neat with only one line of code:

* The `showDigit()` function is called with a digit number `i` and digit character `inputHexString[i]` to be displayed.
* In this function, the scan pin for the current digit is enabled and is ready to light up.
* We then send to the shift register the binary values corresponding to the segments for the current digit.

We then cycle through all of the digits and repeat the steps above for each one. 

To see it in action, make sure you have `registerClass.py`, `sevenSegDisplay.py` and `STK07-seven-seg-display.py` in your `/root/` directory.

Let's choose a hexadecimal number to display on the 7-seg. Come up with a string that looks like this: `0x12ab`, where the four digits **12ab** can be any number from 0 to 9 OR a letter from A to F. Then run the following command in the terminal, replacing `YOURHEXNUMBERHERE` with your string:

``` bash
python /root/STK07-seven-seg-display.py YOURHEXNUMBERHERE
```

This numbering system is known as **hexadecimal** or base 16, where each digit can have a value from 0 - 15; the numbers 10 to 15 are represented by the letters A to F respectively. This is different from our everyday decimal (base 10) system where each digit can have a value from 0-9. Hexadecimal ("hex" for short) is very useful in expressing binary numbers with few digits. For example, the eight-digit binary number `0b11000000` (192 in decimal) can be expressed in two digits in hex as `0xC0`!

### What to Expect

If run correctly, the code above should print the digits one by one on the 7-segment display. If the hex number was not entered in correctly, it will print an error message and exit.

The code runs in an infinite loop which you can exit with `Ctrl-C` (`Cmd-C` for Mac users).

<!-- // TODO: gif: add a gif of what happens -->

Wow, what's up with that?

You may be wondering if what you saw is expected behaviour - the answer is **yes**. The digits on the 7-seg will be flickering slowly enough for you to notice. However, you probably guessed that it really should be displaying them all at once.

### A Closer Look at the Code

This code couldn't exactly do what we needed it to, but there are still some important concepts shown here.

To display numbers on the 7-seg, we mapped the characters to binary bytestrings using a **dictionary**. We also **included a class within another class** to better abstract the operation of the physical components. 

However, the end result was limited by the software we used: we wanted and expected the 7-segment display to light up all at once, but our script couldn't make it happen fast enough. This is because the underlying `onionGpio` class is written so that it accesses the filesystem multiple times for each GPIO write, and the Omega cannot run these commands fast enough.

#### Software Limitations

In this experiment, the software and hardware interact to produce behaviour we didn't intend. The code runs as well as it possibly can, and the hardware does its best to operate from the signals its given, but ultimately the result is not workable. The root cause is the way the `onionGpio` library is programmed. 

The GPIOs are operated by reading and writing to files. Every time we call `onionGpio.setValue()` on a GPIO, the library does the following:

1. Takes control of or "exports" the GPIO in the filesystem
1. Sets the GPIO's direction to output
1. Sets the GPIO's output value
1. Releases or "unexports" the GPIO for future use

The `onionGpio` module does this in a very safe and consistent way via our C library. However, this also means that it's quite slow and not fast enough for our display.

#### Classes using Classes

You'll notice that we declare an object of the `ShiftRegister` class within the `SevenSegment` class. This is a good example of the following concepts:

* **Code reusability:** Earlier we wrote an independent class for the shift register, but now we're using it like a Lego block to build something new. This lets us focus on new code for the 7-seg. We can do this for any other device that requires a shift register without writing another copy of the class.
* **Abstraction:** The `ShiftRegister` class gives us full control over a shift register device. However, when we're working with a 7-seg, we don't really care about the shift register anymore. At most, we should only have to tell the `ShiftRegister` object which GPIOs to use and it would take care of the rest while we work on translating text input into which LED segments to light up.

These ideas makes it easier to think about how different pieces of a project work together. This helps us focus on designing systems and logic rather than getting bogged down in the details.

#### Dictionary

So far we've been working with lists, which are collections of one or more data values in order. The values in lists are indexed by numbers, for example `students[3]`. However, there are times when we're more interested in giving these values meaningful names than working with them in order. Enter the **dictionary!**

Dictionaries are data structures that contain **key-value pairs**. A key is a name or label, and the value is some data that you want to associate with that key; it could even be another dictionary! Dictionaries are indexed by their keys, for example `students["Bobby Tables"]`. 

Let's look at the `digitMap` dictionary used to store the bytestrings for each character in the `SevenSegment` class:

``` python
digitMap = {
    "0": "00111111",
    "1": "00000110",
    "2": "01011011",
    "3": "01001111",
    "4": "01100110",
    # and so on
}
```

Instead of creating individual variables for each and every character, we can use the dictionary to act as a translator between characters and the values that need to be written to the shift register. if we wanted to display the character `1`, we send the required bytestring to the shift register by calling `digitMap["1"]` instead of typing `00000110`; the same goes for any other character. 

We can use this to keep our code neat and short. By using the values of other variables as keys, we can turn this:

``` python
if character == "a":
    shiftReg.outputBits("01110111")
elif character == "b":
    shiftReg.outputBits("01111100")
# and so on
```

Into this:

``` python
shiftReg.outputBits(SevenSegment.digitMap[character])
```

>In Python, dictionary keys can be strings, integers, or tuples. In the digitMap dictionary, we use strings to make it easy to work with other functions that send strings, for example from command line arguments in our main script.

Dictionaries work similarly in programming as they do in real life: You can find a definition (value) by looking up a name or title (key). Dictionaries are also **mutable**, meaning that you can add new key-value pairs, or modify existing ones!

Dictionaries have similar concepts in other programming languages, such as `Objects` in JavaScript and `structs` in C.

### A Better Way?

Our Python implementation couldn't perform as fast as we needed it due to how the `onionGpio` library performs multiple file writes when working with the GPIOs. However, we have another tool up our sleeve: **ash**!

ash, or the Almquist Shell, is a lightweight Unix shell. One of its variants, BusyBox ash, is included in the Omega's firmware and can be run by calling `sh`. This tool is used for running **shell scripts**, which are collections of terminal commands structured like a program.

We've changed how we're going to be accessing and controlling the GPIOs by working with the filesystem directly. If you'd like to see how that looks, we've provided a shell script below that does this properly.

Create a file called `STK07-ash-seven-segment-display.sh` and paste the following in it:

``` bash
#!/bin/sh

# read the command line argument
input=$1
# get the length of the input string
len=${#input}

# variables for each character in the input string
pref1="$(echo $input | sed -e 's/^\(.\).*/\1/')"
pref2="$(echo $input | sed -e 's/^.\(.\).*/\1/')"
chr1="$(echo $input | sed -e 's/^..\(.\).*/\1/')"
chr2="$(echo $input | sed -e 's/^...\(.\).*/\1/')"
chr3="$(echo $input | sed -e 's/^....\(.\).*/\1/')"
chr4="$(echo $input | sed -e 's/^.....\(.\).*/\1/')"

# check if the input string is formatted correctly
if  [[ "$len" -ge "7" || "$pref1" != "0" || "$pref2" != "x" ]]; then
    echo "Please input a hex number in the following format: 0x12ab"
    exit
fi

# digit mapping
# there is no dictionary-type data structure in ash, so must write these by hand
mapDigit(){
    if [ "$1" == "0" ]; then
        echo "0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1"
    elif [ "$1" == "1" ]; then
        echo "0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0"
    elif [ "$1" == "2" ]; then
        echo "0 1 0 1 1 0 1 1"
    elif [ "$1" == "3" ]; then
        echo "0 1 0 0 1 1 1 1"
    elif [ "$1" == "4" ]; then
        echo "0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0"
    elif [ "$1" == "5" ]; then
        echo "0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1"
    elif [ "$1" == "6" ]; then
        echo "0 1 1 1 1 1 0 1"
    elif [ "$1" == "7" ]; then
        echo "0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1"
    elif [ "$1" == "8" ]; then
        echo "0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1"
    elif [ "$1" == "9" ]; then
        echo "0 1 1 0 1 1 1 1"
    elif [[ "$1" == "a" || "$1" == "A" ]]; then
        echo "0 1 1 1 0 1 1 1"
    elif [[ "$1" == "b" || "$1" == "B" ]]; then
        echo "0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0"
    elif [[ "$1" == "c" || "$1" == "C" ]]; then
        echo "0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0"
    elif [[ "$1" == "d" || "$1" == "D" ]]; then
        echo "0 1 0 1 1 1 1 0"
    elif [[ "$1" == "e" || "$1" == "E" ]]; then
        echo "1 0 0 1 1 1 1 0" # fix
    elif [[ "$1" == "f" || "$1" == "F" ]]; then
        echo "1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0" # fix
    else
        echo "Invalid hex digit $1."
        exit
    fi
}

# map the digits in the input string to their bytestrings

done
```

Now run this script in the same way as the Python script before, except replace `python` with `sh`:

```
sh /root/STK07-ash-seven-seg-display.sh YOURHEXNUMBERHERE
```

#### What to Expect

You should now see the characters display without flickering, much better than last time!

<!-- TODO: gif -->

#### A Closer Look at the Shell Script

This shell script looks a lot different from our Python code! The biggest difference is that there are **no lists nor dictionaries** in ash, and that we only **export the GPIOs once**.

##### No Lists Nor Dictionaries

In our Python script, we were able to access each individual character of the input hex string by simply treating the string as a list and iterating over each character, as in `inputHexString[i]`. However, ash doesn't support lists and so we have to load each character into its own variable, `chr1` to `chr4`. This is done using the `sed` command; for a full reference of this powerful tool, check out this [online tutorial](http://www.grymoire.com/Unix/Sed.html).

The same goes for our digit map. Since we can't simply call `digitMap[character]`, we wrote a function `mapDigit()` that takes a character as an argument and returns the corresponding bytestring if found.

##### Exporting the GPIOs Once

Since we know that the GPIOs are all supposed to be outputs only, we can export them only once at the beginning and not have to worry about freeing them up for other purposes later.

The rest of the script is similar to the Python implementation where we repeatedly change the scan pin and send different values to the shift register. This is faster because we only now have to access the filesystem **once** to set the GPIOs each time!

>Writing this type of code requires a deeper understanding of how the hardware and software interact. If you're curious, you can take a look at some examples in our [Developing Using the Command Line Guide](#developing-using-the-command-line).

## Reading a Switch




### GPIO Pins as Input

<!-- {{!insert 'gpio-input'}} -->
```{r child = '../../shared/gpio-input.md'}
```


### Switches

<!-- {{!insert 'switches'}} -->
```{r child = '../../shared/switches.md'}
```


### Slide Switches

<!-- {{!insert 'switches-slide-switch'}} -->
```{r child = '../../shared/switches-slide-switch.md'}
```


### Building the Circuit

// circuit 1: switch controls turning an LED on and off to illustrate the concept

// circuit 2: switch connected to GPIO, controls LED with software


#### Hooking up the Components

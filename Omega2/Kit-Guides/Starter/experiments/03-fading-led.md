## Dimming an LED {#starter-kit-fading-led}

So far we've been turning LEDs fully on and fully off, but it's also possible have LEDs dimmed to somewhere between on and off. And that's what we're going to do in this experiment: we're going to use Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) to create a dimming effect on an LED.

<!-- Pulse Width Modulation -->
```{r child = '../../shared/pwm.md'}
```

#### PWM and LEDs

By sending a PWM signal to an LED, we can control how bright that LED appears to shine. What's actually going on is that the LED is turning on and off many, many times in a second. For example, if we send a 50% duty cycle PWM signal at 50 Hz to an LED, it will be on for 10ms, then be off for 10ms, then be on for 10ms and so on. You won't actually see the LED turning on and off, instead you'll see that the LED looks much dimmer than when you set the duty cycle to 100%.

### Building the Circuit

We're going to be providing power to the LED just like we did in the two previous experiments. The only difference is the speed at which we turn the LED on and off, and that will be taken care of in the software!

We'll make the same LED circuit we used in the [first experiment](#starter-kit-blinking-led-building-the-circuit), so wire that back up.

#### What You'll Need

* Omega2 plugged into Expansion Dock
* 1x LED
* 2x M-M Jumper Wires
* 1x 200Î© Resistor
* Breadboard

#### Hooking up the Components

In this example we'll only be fading a single LED, so go ahead and build the same LED circuit we used in the previous two experiments:

```{r child = '../../shared/wiring-led.md'}
```

Your circuit should look like this:

### Writing the Code

Let's get to writing the main code. This time, we will be using `fast-gpio`, a utility we created to quickly control GPIO signals from the command line. However, we can also call this utility from within a Python script!

We'll use the PWM functionality of `fast-gpio` to slowly increase the LED's brightness by incrementing the duty cycle on its GPIO, then slowly decrease the brightness by decreasing the duty cycle. You'll be seeing the light gently fade in and out.

Create a file called `STK03-fading-led.py` and paste the following code in it:

``` python
import time
import os

# specify sleep duration to be used in the program
sleepTime = 0.1

# define other program parameters
brightnessIncrement  = 2
dutyCycle = 0

# create a PWM signal using the fast-gpio system utility
def pwmLed(pin, frequency, dutyCyclePercentage):
	# create a string to hold our command line code,assign the function arguments to fast-gpio command arguments
    command = "fast-gpio pwm %d %d %d" % (pin, frequency, dutyCyclePercentage)
	# execute the command using the OS
	os.system(command)

# infinite loop - runs main program code continuously
while 1:
	# Increment the duty cycle by the brightnessIncrement
    dutyCycle=dutyCycle+brightnessIncrement

	# Assign GPIO 0 to the pwm duty cycle value
    pwmLed(0, 50, dutyCycle)

    # flip the value variable
    if (dutyCycle <= 0) or (dutyCycle >= 100):
		# Reverse direction at 0, and 100
        brightnessIncrement = -brightnessIncrement

	# make the program pause
    time.sleep(sleepTime)
```

### What to Expect

<!-- // Your LED will fade in and then out, describe this and have a gif -->

When you run this script your LED will fade in and out. This is because we set the duty cycle to increase up to 100% (fade in to 100%), and then we begin to decrease the duty cycle down to 0% (fade out to 0%).

### A Closer Look at the Code

<!-- // intro to the code that was written
//  new things introduced:
//  * function where you pass in gpio # and duty cycle and it calls fast-gpio for you
//  * fancy for loop -->

The code this time is quite different from the previous two experiments. Instead of using Python classes and objects, we are calling a **command-line program** from within the script. We then wrapped this call in a Python **function** to make it easier to reuse.

In our infinite loop, we increment the duty cycle by the `brightnessIncrement`, and at 100% we reverse the value and decrement to 0.

#### Making OS Calls

`fast-gpio` works by setting GPIO registers directly on the processor and is a very fast process. It is fast enough that it can be used to generate PWM signals (this is known as software PWM).

In order to use `fast-gpio`, we need to use the `os` module. This module allows us to send command-line arguments in Python using `os.system(command)`, where `command` is a string containing the arguments you would normally type in the terminal. This is known as a **system call**.

<!-- TODO: FUTURE: get this working using subprocess.call. Gabe quickly tried it but it didn't seem to work at first -->

#### Functions

<!-- // explanation of why it was useful to package the fast-gpio os call into a function:
//  * useful to have a readable & simple python interface for setting the pwm duty cycle
//  * will be used a whole bunch
//  * cleaner looking code and good practice -->

The system call to `fast-gpio` is powerful, but it has a lot of variable placeholders such as `%d` that we don't want to be typing over and over again. So, we wrapped this unwieldy call into its own **function** in order to have a readable and much nicer Python interface for setting the PWM duty cycle. This function takes in the following arguments:

* GPIO pin number
* Frequency
* Duty cycle percentage

By doing this we make it really easy to reuse for other pins, frequencies, and duty cycle values.

Whenever you have problems that require identical commands to solve, it's good practice to write your commands once in single functions that can be called wherever they are needed.

Next we'll learn how to [read a switch](#starter-kit-reading-switch).

## Controlling an LCD Screen {#starter-kit-controlling-an-lcd-screen}

<!-- // in this experiment, we will:
//  * be building on the previous experiment
//  * writing to an lcd screen
//    * using the i2c protocol -->

In this experiment, we will be building on the previous experiment by adding an LCD screen and writing a script to display the temperature sensor data on it. If you start thinking about how to run this in the background, we have something planned for that too!

**Note**: We will be building heavily from the [temperature sensor experiment](#starter-kit-temp-sensor). If you haven't done it, we highly recommend doing so, or at least giving the article a read through.


<!-- lcd -->
```{r child = '../../shared/lcd.md'}
```

<!-- i2c -->
```{r child = '../../shared/i2c.md'}
```

### Building the Circuit

<!-- // start from the temperature sensor circuit
// straight-forward addition: I2C SCL+SDA, Vcc (3.3V), GND -->
To get this experiment up and running, we'll be using the same temperature sensor circuit from the previous experiment, but we'll also be connecting the I2C display to the Omega so we can display the temperature on it. The code we write will tie the two together, but the build will borrow heavily from the [previous experiment](#starter-kit-temp-sensor).

#### What You'll Need

Everything from the [temperature sensor experiment](#starter-kit-temp-sensor):

* 1x Omega plugged into Expansion Dock
* 1x Breadboard
* 3x Jumper wires (M-M)
* 1x 5.1kÎ© (yellow-purple-red) Resistor
* 1x 1-Wire temperature sensor
    * Should read "Dallas 18B20" on the part

Additionally, grab the following from your kit:

* 1x LCD Screen
* 4x Jumper wires (M-F)

#### Hooking up the Components

<!-- // refer them back to the temp sensor article for that part

// some i2c devices will require pull-up resistors on one, or both of SCL and SDA
// [experiment with the i2c screen and see if it needs the resistors]
// Gabe: the community member's tutorial has the screen hooked straight to the GPIOs, no pullups, but requires 5V power -->

The main sensor circuit is exactly the same as the [previous experiment](#starter-kit-temp-sensor). If you've already taken it apart, no worries, just wire it back up exactly as before and you'll be ready for the next step!

Once you have the temperature sensor circuit up and ready, connect the pins from the I2C display to the Expansion Dock according to this table:

| Display Pin | Expansion Dock |
|---------|----------------|
| GND     | GND            |
| VCC     | 5V             |
| SDA     | SDA            |
| SCL     | SCL            |

Note that this time, we're using the 5V pin instead of the 3.3V source that we've been using previously. This is because the display requires a higher voltage to run.

All done! If everything goes well, it should look something like this:

<!-- TODO: IMAGE assembled circuit -->

### Writing the Code

<!-- // have a script that:
//  * reads the temperature data
//  * writes the time and temperature to the display once a minute
//    * use the onion i2c module to write to the display -->

For this experiment, we'll be using our Onion I2C Python Module which greatly simplifies interacting with I2C devices. If you're curious, you can see how it works in our [I2C Python module reference](https://docs.onion.io/omega2-docs/i2c-python-module.html).

>The LCD display driver code is based on user [**natbett**'s post](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=32&t=34261&p=378524) on the Raspberry Pi forums.


<!-- // TODO: include a block diagram of our software system -->

First, let's create a file that has all the low level code needed to drive the LCD display. It will contain functions to write strings and characters, and utility functions to change the behaviour of the display.

Create a file called `lcdDriver.py` and paste the following in it:

``` python

En = 0b00000100 # Enable bit

Rs = 0b00000001 # Register select bit

class Lcd:
    #initializes objects and lcd
    def __init__(self,address,port=0):
        self.address = address
        self.lcdbacklight = LCD_BACKLIGHT #default status
        self.line1= "";
        self.line2= "";
        self.line3= "";
        self.line4= "";

        # use the Onion I2C module to handle reading/writing
        self.lcd_device = onionI2C.OnionI2C(port)

        self.lcd_write(0x03)
        self.lcd_write(0x03)
        self.lcd_write(0x03)
        self.lcd_write(0x02)

        self.lcd_write(LCD_FUNCTIONSET | LCD_2LINE | LCD_5x8DOTS | LCD_4BITMODE)
        self.lcd_write(LCD_DISPLAYCONTROL | LCD_DISPLAYON)
        self.lcd_write(LCD_CLEARDISPLAY)
        self.lcd_write(LCD_ENTRYMODESET | LCD_ENTRYLEFT)
        sleep(0.2)

    # clocks EN to latch command
    def lcd_strobe(self, data):
        self.lcd_device.write(self.address, data | En | self.lcdbacklight)
        sleep(.0005)
        self.lcd_device.write(self.address, ((data & ~ En) | self.lcdbacklight))
        sleep(.0001)

    def lcd_write_four_bits(self, data):
        self.lcd_device.write(self.address, data | self.lcdbacklight)
        self.lcd_strobe(data)

    # write a command to lcd
    def lcd_write(self, cmd, mode=0):
        self.lcd_write_four_bits(mode | (cmd & 0xF0))
        self.lcd_write_four_bits(mode | ((cmd << 4) & 0xF0))

    # write a string to the display
    def lcd_display_string(self, string, line):
        if line == 1:
            self.line1 = string;
            self.lcd_write(0x80)
        if line == 2:
            self.line2 = string;
            self.lcd_write(0xC0)
        if line == 3:
            self.line1 = string;
            self.lcd_write(0x94)
        if line == 4:
            self.line4 = string;
            self.lcd_write(0xD4)

        for char in string:
            self.lcd_write(ord(char), Rs)

    # print an array of strings        
    def lcd_display_string_array(self, strings):
        for i in range(min(len(strings), 4)):
            self.lcd_display_string(strings[i], i+1)

    # clear lcd and set to home
    def lcd_clear(self):
        self.lcd_write(LCD_CLEARDISPLAY)
        self.lcd_write(LCD_RETURNHOME)

    def refresh(self):
        self.lcd_display_string(self.line1,1)
        self.lcd_display_string(self.line2,2)
        self.lcd_display_string(self.line3,3)
        self.lcd_display_string(self.line4,4)

    #def backlight
    def backlightOn(self):
        self.lcdbacklight = LCD_BACKLIGHT
        self.refresh()

    def backlightOff(self):
        self.lcdbacklight = LCD_NOBACKLIGHT
        self.refresh()
```

Now let's write the main routine for the experiment. This script will create an `Lcd` object, and a `TemperatureSensor` object. It gets the sensor data from the `TemperatureSensor`, then sends that data to the `Lcd` object to display. It does this once and exactly once, so you can call it whenever for a quick update.

Create a file called `STK09-temperatureLCD.py` and paste the code below into it. Copy the file to `/root` on your Omega, run it with Python, and you should get a reading!

``` python
import datetime
import lcdDriver
import oneWire
from temperatureSensor import TemperatureSensor

# default address of i2c backpack is 0x3f by default
lcdAddress = 0x3f  

# setup one wire temperature sensor object
oneWireGpio = 19 # set the GPIO that we've connected the sensor to
pollingInterval = 1 # seconds

def getTemp():
    # check if 1-Wire was setup in the kernel
    if not oneWire.setupOneWire(str(oneWireGpio)):
        print "Kernel module could not be inserted. Please reboot and try again."
        return -1

    # get the address of the temperature sensor
    # it should be the only device connected in this experiment
    sensorAddress = oneWire.scanOneAddress()

    sensor = TemperatureSensor("oneWire", { "address": sensorAddress, "gpio": oneWireGpio })
    if not sensor.ready:
        print "Sensor was not set up correctly. Please make sure that your sensor is firmly connected to the GPIO specified above and try again."
        return -1

    return sensor.readValue()

def displayTemp(temp):
    # setup LCD
    lcd = lcdDriver.Lcd(lcdAddress)
    lcd.backlightOn()

    time = datetime.today()

    lcd.lcd_display_string_array([
        "The time is:",
        time + "\n",
        "Temperature:",
        str(temp) + " C"
    ])

def __main__():
    t = getTemp()
    displayTemp(t)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    __main__()
```

### What to Expect

Calling the script will update the LCD screen with a fresh temperature reading.

<!-- TODO: IMAGE gif of the setup with the temperature changing-->

Wouldn't it be nice if something could run the script for us every minute to actually update the LCD? We will get there in a bit, but for now, let's take a look at how the code works.

### A Closer Look at the Code

Here we've introduced the **Onion I2C module**. The Python module takes care of the complexities in working with I2C devices, exposing a set of easy to work with functions. In the process, we've also started to let **multiple objects** interact with each other - actually making apparent the benefits of abstraction.

#### The Onion I2C Module

<!-- // introduce the onion i2c module, written by Onion to facilitate the easy use of the i2c bus
// give a brief overview of the functions that we used and point them to the documentation reference (need to include docs.onion.io link, not markdown tag) -->

We wrote this module to make it easy for you to use the I2C bus. I2C based electronics are designed to operate with a minimum of instructions and very specific signalling between host and client. Our I2C modules does all the signalling and contact establishing for you so you only need to worry about sending the correct data and reading the correct registers. For a detailed look on how it works, we've written up a software reference to our [I2C Python Module](#i2c-python-module).

In the code, we specifically use two main functions of the library: the **constructor** and `i2cDevice.write_cmd()`. The constructor creates an I2C device object with the given address. The `write_cmd()` function then writes the given command (in bytes) to the address. The LCD display requires specific commands in order to activate its different write modes which the lcdDriver class wraps up nicely, making our final execution script quite compact.

#### Multiple Different Objects

<!-- // DONE: small blurb about how the main program uses two objects of different classes to accomplish its purpose - make a note that this is an incredibly common programming method/technique -->

Here we're using two objects of different classes to accomplish our goal, `TemperatureSensor` and `Lcd`. If we had other devices we wanted to include in this experiment, we can write more class definitions and load them using the `import` statement.

This is an incredibly common programming technique and is at the heart of Object Oriented Programming! It helps us capture and understand interactions between complex pieces through simplifying them in a human-readable way.

It's much easier to think about getting a reading from your `sensor` object, then to deal with the complexities of sending serial data to and from a 1-Wire device and all the conversion you need to do from that data. Instead, we get a line like `return sensor.readValue()` which we can immediately understand.

>Although it's a powerful tool, too much abstraction can create its own problems. Ultimately, writing smart, self-documenting code comes from lots of practise and communication between you and the people you share your work with!


### Going Further: Automating the Script

<!-- DONE: has this been tested? last time I did it using the omega1 instructions and it didn't work (Gabe) 

May have worked differently on the omega1? The current iteration of instructions works on Omega2 firmware 149. It will successfully call a properly written shell script on the minute, every minute. If you're testing with `echo`, note that it dumps into /dev/null or some other black hole, pipe it into a file to see it working properly. (James)
-->

We can use the `cron` Linux utility to automatically run the script once every minute, without having to tie up your system by leaving Python running.


First, create a file in `/root` called `checkTempSensor.sh` and write the following in it:

``` sh
##!/bin/sh -e
/usr/bin/python /root/temperatureLCD.py
```

Then change the file permissions so it becomes executable:

```
chmod +x checkTempSensor.sh
```

Run `crontab -e` to edit the file that contains commands and schedules to run them, and add this line to the end of the file:

```
* * * * * /root/checkTempSensor.sh
```

>To briefly explain, the asterisks (\*) mean 'for all instances'. The position of the asterisk corresponds to 'minute', 'hour', 'date', 'month', and 'year' in order from left to right. The path at the end is the script or command you want to run. Basically, this line tells cron to run the `checkTempSensor.sh` script once a minute.

**Note** that you'll have to [use `vi`](http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/New_to_Vim) to edit this file by default!

Finally, run the following command to restart cron so it can start running your script:

```
/user/sbin/crond restart
```

Your LCD should now update once a minute, and you're free to use your Omega for other things in the meantime!

#### Known Issues

At the time of writing this guide, `crond restart` will start a new instance of cron. If you want to be circumspect, we recommend running `pidof crond` to check how many instances are currently running. The output of `pidof` should be either nothing (no `crond` running at all) or a list of numbers. Each number is the process ID (`pid`) of a running instance of `crond`. You can call `kill <pid>` to stop the process associated with that ID.

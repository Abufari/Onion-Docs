## Controlling an LCD Screen {#starter-kit-controlling-an-lcd-screen}

<!-- // in this experiment, we will:
//  * be building on the previous experiment
//  * writing to an lcd screen
//    * using the i2c protocol -->

In this experiment, we will be building on the previous experiment by adding an LCD screen and writing a script to display the temperature sensor data on it. If you start thinking about how to run this in the background, we have something planned for that too!

**Note**: We will be building heavily from the [temperature sensor experiment](#starter-kit-temp-sensor). If you haven't done it, we highly recommend doing so, or at least giving the article a read through.


<!-- lcd -->
```{r child = '../../shared/lcd.md'}
```

<!-- i2c -->
```{r child = '../../shared/i2c.md'}
```

### Building the Circuit

<!-- // start from the temperature sensor circuit
// straight-forward addition: I2C SCL+SDA, Vcc (3.3V), GND -->
To get this experiment up and running, we'll be using the same temperature sensor circuit from the previous experiment, but we'll also be connecting the I2C display to the Omega so we can display the temperature on it. The code we write will tie the two together, but the build will borrow heavily from the [previous experiment](#starter-kit-temp-sensor).

We'll be building the following circuit:

![Circuit diagram](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OnionIoT/Onion-Docs/master/Omega2/Kit-Guides/Starter/diagrams/09-circuit-diagram.png)

#### What You'll Need

Everything from the [temperature sensor experiment](#starter-kit-temp-sensor):

* 1x Omega plugged into Expansion Dock
* 1x Breadboard
* 3x Jumper wires (M-M)
* 1x 5.1kÎ© (yellow-purple-red) Resistor
* 1x 1-Wire temperature sensor
    * Should read "Dallas 18B20" on the part

Additionally, grab the following from your kit:

* 1x LCD Screen
* 4x Jumper wires (M-F)

#### Hooking up the Components

<!-- // refer them back to the temp sensor article for that part

// some i2c devices will require pull-up resistors on one, or both of SCL and SDA
// [experiment with the i2c screen and see if it needs the resistors]
// Gabe: the community member's tutorial has the screen hooked straight to the GPIOs, no pullups, but requires 5V power -->

The main sensor circuit is exactly the same as the [previous experiment](#starter-kit-temp-sensor). If you've already taken it apart, no worries, just wire it back up exactly as before and you'll be ready for the next step!

Once you have the temperature sensor circuit up and ready, connect the pins from the I2C display to the Expansion Dock according to this table:

| Display Pin | Expansion Dock |
|---------|----------------|
| GND     | GND            |
| VCC     | 5V             |
| SDA     | SDA            |
| SCL     | SCL            |

Note that this time, we're using the 5V pin instead of the 3.3V source that we've been using previously. This is because the display requires a higher voltage to run.

All done! If everything is connected properly, the LCD should light up with a bright green background and a row of black boxes on the top row. If it doesn't light up, check that the jumper on the back of the LCD is firmly connected to the `LED` pins hanging off the side.

Your setup should look something like this:

<!-- DONE: IMAGE assembled circuit -->
![Assembled circuit](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OnionIoT/Onion-Docs/master/Omega2/Kit-Guides/Starter/img/09-assembled-circuit.jpg)

Once you've made sure that you've wired it up correctly, you can then flip over the LCD screen so that it is facing you.

If the display lights up but you can't see any black boxes, you may need to adjust the contrast on the display. There is a small grey screw on the back; use a Philips screwdriver to turn it and adjust it so that the boxes appear. This will define how clear the text will be on the display.

<!-- DONE: IMAGE contrast adjustment screw -->

### Writing the Code

<!-- // have a script that:
//  * reads the temperature data
//  * writes the time and temperature to the display once a minute
//    * use the onion i2c module to write to the display -->

For this experiment, we'll be using our Onion I2C Python Module which greatly simplifies interacting with I2C devices. If you're curious, you can see how it works in our [I2C Python module reference](https://docs.onion.io/omega2-docs/i2c-python-module.html).

>The LCD display driver code is based on user [**natbett**'s post](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=32&t=34261&p=378524) on the Raspberry Pi forums.

This is the plan for how we'll implement our code:

First, let's write a file with the low level code needed to drive the LCD display. It will contain functions to write strings and characters, and utility functions to change the behaviour of the display.

Create a file called `lcdDriver.py` and paste the following in it:

class Lcd:
    #initializes objects and lcd
    def __init__(self,address, port=0):
        # i2c device parameters
        self.address = address
        self.i2c = onionI2C.OnionI2C(port)

        # lcd defaults
        self.lcdbacklight = LCD_BACKLIGHT #default status
        self.line1= "";

        self.lcdWrite(0x03)
        self.lcdWrite(0x02)

        self.lcdWrite(LCD_FUNCTIONSET | LCD_2LINE | LCD_5x8DOTS | LCD_4BITMODE)
        self.lcdWrite(LCD_DISPLAYCONTROL | LCD_DISPLAYON)
        self.lcdWrite(lcdClearDISPLAY)
        self.lcdWrite(LCD_ENTRYMODESET | LCD_ENTRYLEFT)
        time.sleep(initSleep)

	# function to write byte to the screen via I2C
    def writeBytesToLcd(self, cmd):
        self.i2c.write(self.address, [cmd])
        time.sleep(writeSleep)

    # creates an EN pulse (using I2C) to latch previously sent command
    def lcdStrobe(self, data):
        self.writeBytesToLcd(data | En | self.lcdbacklight)
        time.sleep(.0005)
        self.writeBytesToLcd(((data & ~ En) | self.lcdbacklight))
        time.sleep(.0001)

    def lcdWriteFourBits(self, data):
		# write four data bits along with backlight state to the screen
        self.writeBytesToLcd(data | self.lcdbacklight)

		self.lcdStrobe(data)

    # function to write an 8-bit command to lcd
    def lcdWrite(self, cmd, mode=0):
		# due to how the I2C backpack expects data, we need to send the top four and bottom four bits of the command separately
        self.lcdWriteFourBits(mode | (cmd & 0xF0))
        self.lcdWriteFourBits(mode | ((cmd << 4) & 0xF0))

    # function to display a string on the screen
    def lcdDisplayString(self, string, line):
        if line == 1:
            self.line1 = string;
            self.lcdWrite(0x80)
        if line == 2:
            self.line2 = string;
            self.lcdWrite(0xC0)
        if line == 3:
            self.line3 = string;
            self.lcdWrite(0x94)
        if line == 4:
            self.line4 = string;
            self.lcdWrite(0xD4)

        for char in string:
            self.lcdWrite(ord(char), Rs)

    def lcdDisplayStringList(self, strings):
        for x in range(0, min(len(strings), 4)):
            self.lcdDisplayString(strings[x], x+1)

    # clear lcd and set to home
    def lcdClear(self):
        self.lcdWrite(lcdClearDISPLAY)
        self.lcdWrite(LCD_RETURNHOME)

	# write the current lines to the screen
    def refresh(self):
        self.lcdDisplayString(self.line1,1)
        self.lcdDisplayString(self.line2,2)
        self.lcdDisplayString(self.line3,3)
        self.lcdDisplayString(self.line4,4)

    # turn on the backlight
    def backlightOn(self):
        self.lcdbacklight = LCD_BACKLIGHT
        self.refresh()

	# turn off the backlight
    def backlightOff(self):
        self.lcdbacklight = LCD_NOBACKLIGHT
        self.refresh()
```

Now let's write the main routine for the experiment. This script will create an `Lcd` object, and a `TemperatureSensor` object. It gets the sensor data from the `TemperatureSensor`, then sends that data to the `Lcd` object to display. It does this once and exactly once, so you can call it whenever for a quick update.

Create a file called `STK09-temperatureLCD.py` and paste the code below into it.

``` python
import lcdDriver
import oneWire
from temperatureSensor import TemperatureSensor

# default address of i2c backpack is 0x3f by default
lcdAddress = 0x3f  

# setup one wire temperature sensor object
oneWireGpio = 19 # set the GPIO that we've connected the sensor to
pollingInterval = 1 # seconds

# function to read the temperature from the One-Wire Temperature Sensor
def getTemp():
    # check if 1-Wire was setup in the kernel
    if not oneWire.setupOneWire(str(oneWireGpio)):
        print "Kernel module could not be inserted. Please reboot and try again."
        return -1

    # get the address of the temperature sensor
    # it should be the only device connected in this experiment
    sensorAddress = oneWire.scanOneAddress()

    sensor = TemperatureSensor("oneWire", { "address": sensorAddress, "gpio": oneWireGpio })
    if not sensor.ready:
        print "Sensor was not set up correctly. Please make sure that your sensor is firmly connected to the GPIO specified above and try again."
        return -1

    return sensor.readValue()

# function to display the temperature on the LCD screen
def displayTemp(temp):
    # setup LCD
    lcd = lcdDriver.Lcd(lcdAddress)
    lcd.backlightOn()

    lcd.lcdDisplayStringList([
        "Temperature: ",
        str(temp) + " C"
    ])

def __main__():
    t = getTemp()
    displayTemp(t)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    __main__()
```

### What to Expect

Calling the script will update the LCD screen with a fresh temperature reading.

Wouldn't it be nice if something could run the script for us every minute to actually update the LCD? We will get there in a bit, but for now, let's take a look at how the code works.

### A Closer Look at the Code

Here we've introduced the **Onion I2C module**. The Python module takes care of the complexities in working with I2C devices, exposing a set of easy to work with functions. In the process, we've also started to let **multiple objects** interact with each other - actually making apparent the benefits of abstraction.

#### The Onion I2C Module

<!-- // introduce the onion i2c module, written by Onion to facilitate the easy use of the i2c bus
// give a brief overview of the functions that we used and point them to the documentation reference (need to include docs.onion.io link, not markdown tag) -->

We wrote this module to make it easy for you to use the I2C bus. I2C based electronics are designed to operate with a minimum of instructions and very specific signalling between host and client. Our I2C modules does all the signalling and contact establishing for you so you only need to worry about sending the correct data and reading the correct registers. For a detailed look on how it works, we've written up a software reference to our [I2C Python Module](#i2c-python-module).

In the code, we specifically use two main functions of the library: the **constructor** and `i2c.write()`. The constructor creates an I2C device object with the given address. The `i2c.write()` function then writes a list of bytes to the device's address (without specifying the memory location on the device). The LCD display requires specific commands in order to activate its different write modes which the lcdDriver class wraps up nicely, making our final execution script quite compact.

#### Multiple Different Objects

<!-- // DONE: small blurb about how the main program uses two objects of different classes to accomplish its purpose - make a note that this is an incredibly common programming method/technique -->

Here we're using two objects of different classes to accomplish our goal, `TemperatureSensor` and `Lcd`. If we had other devices we wanted to include in this experiment, we can write more class definitions and load them using the `import` statement.

This is an incredibly common programming technique and is at the heart of Object Oriented Programming! It helps us capture and understand interactions between complex pieces through simplifying them in a human-readable way.

>Although it's a powerful tool, too much abstraction can create its own problems. Ultimately, writing smart, self-documenting code comes from lots of practise and communication between you and the people you share your work with!


### Going Further: Automating the Script

We can use the `cron` Linux utility to automatically run the script once every minute, without having to tie up your system by leaving Python running. Since `cron` executes from elsewhere in the Linux system, we'll have the give it the *absolute path* to our scripts.

First, take note of which directory your scripts are in by running the command `pwd`. If you're developing in the `/root` folder, you will see:

```
/root
```

Let's assume that you put your scripts in the `/root` directory. So to run our script with an absolute path, the command would be:

```
python /root/STK09-temperatureLCD.py
```

Try it out yourself:

```
cd /
python /root/STK09-temperatureLCD.py
```

Everything should work just like before. Now let's move on to setting up `cron`. Run `crontab -e` to edit the file that contains commands and schedules to run them, and add this line to the end of the file:

```
* * * * * python /root/STK09-temperatureLCD.py
```

>To briefly explain, the asterisks (\*) mean 'for all instances'. The position of the asterisk corresponds to 'minute', 'hour', 'date', 'month', and 'year' in order from left to right. The path at the end is the script or command you want to run. Basically, this line tells cron to run the `STK09-temperatureLCD.py` script once a minute.

**Note** that this will load [`vim`](http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/New_to_Vim) to edit this file by default.

<!-- TODO: update the vim link with our intro vim tutorial -->

Finally, run the following command to restart cron so it can start running your script:

```
/etc/init.d/cron restart
```

Your LCD should now update once a minute, and you're free to use your Omega for other things in the meantime!

To learn more about `cron` on the Omega, see the article on [running a command based on a schedule](https://docs.onion.io/omega2-docs/running-a-command-on-a-schedule.html) in the Omega2 documentation.

### What We're Going to Learn

We're going to learn about the following:

* How to put together circuits on a breadboard  
    * This is an essential skill for electronics prototyping!
* Get comfortable reading circuit diagrams
* Using the Omega's command line interface
* How to flash the microcontroller on the Arduino Dock using the Arduino IDE
* Use Arduino sketches to control external circuits with the Omega and Arduino Dock
	* Programming from the ground-up
	* Learning If statements, For loops, While Loops
	* Writing our own functions
	* Using existing libraries
	* Serial communication with the Omega
	* Object Oriented programming
		* Using classes
		* Writing our own classes


### What's Included

Your Arduino Dock Starter Kit contains the following items; we've labelled them here for your convenience.

### How to Use This Guide

Before getting started on the experiments, set up your Omega by following the [First Time Setup Guide](#first-time-setup).

Then you can learn more on:

1. [Connecting to the Omega's Command Line](#connecting-to-the-omega-terminal)
1. [An introduction to using the command line](#the-command-line)

We strongly recommend reading up on using the Arduino Dock:

1. [Setting up the Arduino IDE to wirelessly flash sketches to the Arduino Dock](#flash-arduino-dock-wirelessly)
1. [Resetting the Arduino Dock's microcontroller](#arduino-dock-reset)
1. [Communication between the Omega and Arduino Dock ATmega microcontroller](#arduino-dock-communicating-via-serial)

Once you've done those, we recommend working your way through the experiments in order as they usually build on what we've learned in each one.


### What Exactly Will I Learn?

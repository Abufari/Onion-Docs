1. [Blinking an LED](#arduino-kit-blinking-led)
    * Learn the basics of programming the Arduino Dock by turning an LED on and off.
1. [Blinking Multiple LEDs](#arduino-kit-multiple-leds)
    * Learn some more programming concepts by controlling multiple LEDs at once.
1. [Reading a Potentiometer](#arduino-kit-reading-a-pot)
    * Read an analog input value from a potentiometer (knob) and use it to control your circuit.
1. [Reading a Button](#arduino-kit-reading-a-push-button)
    * We'll use a push button to control LEDs and learn about interrupts along the way.
1. [Sensing Ambient Temperature](#arduino-kit-reading-a-temp-sensor)
    * Use an analog temperature sensor to report ambient temperature to the Omega.
1. [Sensing Ambient Light Intensity](#arduino-kit-reading-a-photoresistor)
    * Use a photoresistor and a voltage divider circuit to report ambient light intensity to the Omega.
1. [Using a Buzzer](#arduino-kit-using-a-buzzer)
    * We'll make our very own doorbell code and circuit.
1. [Controlling Servos](#arduino-kit-using-a-servo)
    * Learn about object oriented programming and generating pulse width modulated signals to control servomotors
1. [Reading a Keypad](#arduino-kit-reading-a-keypad)
    * Use a keypad to physically password protect a part of a program
1. [Using a Shift Register](#arduino-kit-shift-register)
    * Learn how to use a shift register to effectively expand the number of GPIOs available to us and make a sweet effect with a bunch of LEDs
1. [Controlling a 7-Segment Display](#arduino-kit-seven-segment-display)
    * Send text from the Omega and display it on a 7-segment display!

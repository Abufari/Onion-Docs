## Reading an Analog Temperature Sensor

// description of what this experiment will accomplish and what we'll learn

### Analog Temperature Sensor
// should be its own markdown file

// detects the ambient air temperature
// outputs different voltage based on the temperature

### Building the Circuit

// very straight-forward circuit: provide power and ground to the sensor, connect the signal to an atmega analog pin

#### Hooking up the Components

// walkthrough all of the wiring


## Writing the Code

// write code that:
//  * reads the sensor voltage
//  * converts it to degrees
//  * prints it on the serial line
//    * maybe make it detect once every 10 seconds

### What to Expect

// make the omega connect to the microcontroller using uart1 (link to the article), read the temperature data


### A Closer Look at the Code

#### Math Operations

// give an overview of how we did that convertsion math

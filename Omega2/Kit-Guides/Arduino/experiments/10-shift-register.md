# Using a Shift Register to Control a Bunch of LEDs



// TODO: insert shift register shared content

// TODO: insert controlling shift register shared content


## Building the Circuit

// wire up the microcontroller outputs to the shift register
// have all shift register outputs connected to an LED circuit

### Hooking up the Components

//  * talk about how the IC should be plugged in across the channel of the breadboard (have this note in a markdown file so it can be easily reused)

//  * explain all of the wiring from microcontroller->shift reg
//    * explain each of the lines running from the Omega and what they do - according to the names from the controlling a shift register section


## Writing the Code

// create functions for using the shift register
// create knight rider kitt animation with the leds, see the starter kit shift register article for details

### What to Expect

// explain that the animation will be Knight Rider Kitt style: maybe throw in a gif for nostalgia
//  - it will run all the way left and then all the way right over and over again

### A Closer Look at the Code

// an overview of the code, go into detail about something interesting

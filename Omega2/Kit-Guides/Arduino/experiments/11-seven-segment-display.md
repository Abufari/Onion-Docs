# Controlling a 7-Segment Display

// TODO: insert shared article about the 7seg display


## Building the Circuit

// Atmega->shift register->7seg display

### Hooking up the Components

// copy from the starter kit 7seg article

## Writing the Code

// write a sketch that takes input from the Serial (ie the Omega) and writes it to the 7 seg display
//  * ensure proper input validation is done so that only  hex numbers can be written to the display

### What to Expect

// explanation of what the user should expect when they enter valid numbers

### A Closer Look at the Code

// something interesting about the code

#### Serial Input

// explain how we wait for input to be available and then read it in

### Going Further: Automating the Script

// introduce cron
// show example of how to setup cron to output the time from the omega once a minute

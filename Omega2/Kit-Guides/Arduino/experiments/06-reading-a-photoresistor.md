## Reading a Photoresistor

// description of what this experiment will accomplish and what we'll learn

### Photoresistor
// should be its own markdown file

// explanation that a photoresistor puts out a variable resistance based on the intensity of the light hitting it

### Building the Circuit

// very straight-forward circuit, look it up online

#### Hooking up the Components

// walkthrough all of the wiring


## Writing the Code

// write code that:
//  * reads the sensor voltage
//  * converts it to light intensity
//  * prints it on the serial line
//    * maybe make it detect once every 10 seconds

### What to Expect

// make the omega connect to the microcontroller using uart1 (link to the article), read the light intensity data
// have the user cover the photoresistor with their hand and observe the change in value, have them shine a light at it


### A Closer Look at the Code

// highlight something interesting about this code

#### Output on serial

// explanation of how the omega and atmega chip are linked, go into a little bit of detail

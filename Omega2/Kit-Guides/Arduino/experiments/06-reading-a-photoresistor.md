## Reading a Photoresistor {#arduino-kit-reading-a-photoresistor}

<!-- // description of what this experiment will accomplish and what we'll learn -->
In this tutorial, we will use a photoresistor to detect the ambient light intensity. In order to be able to actually detect the light intensity, we'll need a voltage divider in our circuit. We'll also be sending data from the ATmega to the Omega through the serial port. Let's dive in!

### Building the Circuit

For this circuit we will need use a photoresistor and a 10K resistor to make a voltage divider on a breadboard. We will be using jumper wires for the connections.

<!-- // TODO: IMAGE diagram for a voltage divider -->

$$ V_{out} = \frac{R_2}{R_1+R_2} \cdot V_{in} $$

Using the equation for the voltage divider, we will be able to determine the resistance of the photoresistor and then calculate the light intensity.

#### What You'll Need

Prepare the following components from your kit:

* Omega plugged into Arduino Dock
* USB Micro-B cable for power
* Breadboard
* Jumper wires
* 1x Photoresistor
* 1x 10kÎ© Resistor

#### Hooking up the Components

<!-- // TODO: add an intro (d) -->
<!-- // TODO: IMAGE add a circuit diagram of the circuit we will be building -->

Once you have the components ready, follow these steps:

1. Connect one end of the photoresistor to `5V` and the other end to the 10K resistor (the polarity does not matter).
1. Connect the other end of the 10K resistor to `GND`.
1. Connect the middle point between the photoresistor and resistor to the A0 analog pin on the Arduino Dock

All done! Here's what our finished circuit looks like:

### Writing the Code

<!-- // TODO: intro to the code (d) -->

For this experiment, the code doesn't activate anything, it will simply calculate and print out the resistance and the light intensity level to the console.

If you're ready, copy the code below to `SKA06-photoresistor.ino` and flash it to start reading the light levels!

``` c
int lightPin = A0;  //the pin number connected to the photoresistor
int R1 = 10000;   // resistor value between photoresistor and GND

void setup()
{
    Serial.begin(9600);  //initializing serial communication with the Omega2 for sending sensor data
}

void loop()
{
    // read a value (0 to 1023) from the analog pin and print to the Omega through serial
    int reading = analogRead(lightPin);
    Serial.println(reading);   

    // convert the reading to voltage level (0 to 5V)
    float voltage = reading * 5.0 / 1024.0;
    Serial.print(voltage); Serial.println(" volts");

    // calculate the resistance of the photoresistor based on voltage level and the voltage divider formula:
    // V(A0) = R1/(R1 + Rphoto) * 5V
    float Rphoto = 5.0 / voltage * R1 - R1;
    Serial.print(Rphoto/1000); Serial.println(" kohms");

    // convert photoresistance resistance to light intensity in lux
    float lightIntensity = 500/(Rphoto/1000);
    Serial.print(lightIntensity); Serial.println(" lux");

    delay(1000);     //1 second delay between the readings
}
```

Once again, you can read the serial communication from the ATmega by calling:

```
cat /dev/ttyS1
```

### What to Expect

<!-- // make the omega connect to the microcontroller using uart1 (link to the article), read the light intensity data
// have the user cover the photoresistor with their hand and observe the change in value, have them shine a light at it -->

The ATmega will print the output voltage of the voltage divider, the resistance of the photoresitor and the light intensity in lux through the serial port. We can then read the data on the serial port on the Omega with the following command:

```
cat /dev/ttyS1
```

If you cover the photoresistor with your hand, you'll see on your Omega's command line that the light intensity (lux) value will decrease significantly. You'll also see how the resistance of the photoresistor is inverse proportional to the light intensity.

### A Closer Look at the Code

<!-- // TODO: change this text so that it doesn't talk about the previous experiment (d) -->

The code we use is fairly straight forward: we use analogRead to obtain a digital value (0 to 1023), then we convert that data to both voltage and light intensity.

During the calculations, we use `Serial.print()` to send the values at all the stages to the Omega for better understanding the calculation process.

We'll briefly touch on **communicating with serial** in case you missed the last experiment, and we'll go over **output formatting** in C.

#### Output on serial

<!-- // TODO: dive in a little more on this explanation, give a decent explanation and then link to the temp sensor experiment where we go in depth about serial communication (d)-->

[Last time](#arduino-kit-reading-a-temp-sensor), we covered how serial communication works in general, and specifically how it works between the ATmega and the Omega. In case you missed it, serial communication is simply communication where only a single channel is used. Because of that limitation, one party must be set up to listen while the other talks. With the Arduino Dock, we've hooked up the serial output of the ATmega chip directly to a UART pin on the Omega, which means that everything is set up for the Omega to listen to the ATmega!

#### Output Formatting

Arduino's core is actually C code so many functions from the library borrow C conventions and habits, and `print()` is no exception. If you've worked with Python or Javascript, you'll notice that you can print and join strings on the fly.

For example:

```python
var number = 12

print ("Number is " + number)
```

The above is completely valid in Python, and will print out `Number is 12` complete with a new line. To get the same kind of results with Arduino code, we resort to some fiddling to place new line characters and other parts of the string in the appropriate order.

To copy our C example from above in Arduino, we can do:

```
int number = 12;

Serial.print("Number is ");
Serial.println(number);
```

Which is a bit more convoluted, but works just as well with the functions we have access to.

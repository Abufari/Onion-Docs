## Blinking an LED {#blink-led-arduino-kit}

// little intro about our first sketch that we'll run on the arduino dock


// TODO: include shared content on LEDs

## Building the Circuit

Before we start building our experiment, let's first go over some of the building blocks when it comes to experimenting with electronics.

// TODO: insert jumper wires section

// TODO: insert breadboard section

### Hooking up the Components
// can copy from the starter kit, but adapt it for the Arduino Dock

## Writing the Code

// write an arduino sketch to blink an LED

### What to Expect

// flashing wirelessly using the IDE

### A Closer Look at the Code

// highlight something interesting about the code

#### Setting GPIOs to Output

// go through the setup commands we used to use a gpio as an output

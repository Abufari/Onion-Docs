# Writing Text to the OLED Display


## The OLED Display

// introduce the oled display, resolution, number of possible characters in a row, max number of rows

// how it's possible to choose where we write text by moving the cursor

## Building the Circuit

// Simple: just put the OLED Expansion on the Expansion Dock



## Writing the Code

// the program should:
//  * at the top-right of the screen: the current time, nicely formatted (9:33am)
//  * output a time-sensitive greeting (good morning, good afternoon, good evening, etc) two lines below
//  * output a random fact or quote or something at the bottom of the screen

// implementation:
// - have an array with random facts, quotes, etc and generate a random number to select one


### What to Expect

// explain the bullet points from the above
// have some pictures displaying the message


### A Closer Look at the Code

// new topics introduced:
// * generating random numbers

#### Generating Random Numbers

// give background on how random number generation works

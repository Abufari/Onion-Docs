# Changing the Display's Behavior

// this tutorial will show how to change how the OLED displays the images on it based on text-based user input
// we'll be scrolling the display contents as well as dimming and inverting the display, let's jump in.

## The OLED's Settings

// brief intro of each of the available settings we will adjust:
//  * brightness
//  * color inversion
//  * horizontal+diagonal scrolling

## Building the Circuit

// keep the oled plugged in


## Writing the Code

// extend the script from the previous example to be able to enable scrolling based on interactive user input (text-based)
//  * should also be able to dim and invert the screen

### What to Expect

// show the different input options and the scrolling they result in, add gifs

// note on ctrl+c to kill the program

### A Closer Look at the Code

// introduced the concept of interactive user input

#### Reading User Input

// details on user input, pitfalls to avoid

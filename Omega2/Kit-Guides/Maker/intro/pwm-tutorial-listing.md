1. [Dimming LEDs](#maker-kit-servo-dimming-led)
    * Learn about Pulse Width Modulation and controlling LEDs
1. [Controlling Servos](#maker-kit-servo-controlling-servo)
	* Use the PWM Expansion to control Servos and pick up some Python skills along the way
1. [Run a DC Motor with an H-Bridge](#maker-kit-servo-h-bridge)
	* We'll get really creative and use the PWM Expansion to control an H-Bridge chip which will in turn drive a DC motor

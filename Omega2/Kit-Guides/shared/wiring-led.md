1. Plug in the LED into the breadboard, make sure you plug the anode and cathode into different rows and that you know which is plugged where.
1. Now connect one end of a 200Î© resistor to the the cathode row, and the other end to an empty row.
1. Connect the other end of the resistor to a Ground pin on the Omega2.
1. Let's choose `GPIO0` on the Omega2 to drive our LED, so connect a jumper wire from `GPIO0` to the LED's anode.

1. Plug in the LED into the breadboard, make sure you plug the anode and cathode into different rows and that you know which is plugged where.
1. Let's choose `GPIO0` on the Omega2 to drive our LED, so let's run a jumper wire to the row of the LED's anode.
1. Now connect one end of a 200Î© resistor to the the cathode row, and the other end to an empty row.
1. The final step is using a jumper wire to connect the current-limiting resistor to a Ground pin on the Omega2.

#### Wiring Precautions

You may have noticed that we wired up all of the breadboard components and GPIO connections first **before** connecting the main power line. We do this to minimize the risk of making wiring mistakes and powering a circuit that could potentially damage the components or the Omega. This is good practice and we'll be building circuits in this way throughout these experiments.

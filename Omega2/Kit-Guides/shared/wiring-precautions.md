#### Wiring Precautions

You may have noticed that we wired up all of the breadboard components and GPIO connections first **before** connecting the main power line. We do this to minimize the risk of making wiring mistakes and powering a circuit that could potentially damage the components or the Omega. This is good practice and we'll be building circuits in this way throughout these experiments.

If you *really* want to make sure that your components are safe before performing an experiment, you can leave the Omega turned OFF before connecting power to the circuit. Once everything is connected, you can then turn the Omega on again.

### Photoresistor

A photoresistor has a variable resistance based on the intensity of the light hitting it. However, its light intensity is inversely proportional to its resistance: the resistance will decrease when the environment has more light, and increase when there is less light. The photoresistor is made out of a semiconductor with high resistance and can go up to megohms when the environment is dark.

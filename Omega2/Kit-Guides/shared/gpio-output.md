### GPIOs as Outputs

The Omega has fifteen General Purpose Input/Output pins (commonly referred to as GPIOs) that can be fully controlled by you, the user. For now, let's focus on using GPIOs in the output direction.

Once a GPIO is set to the output direction, you can have it output either a logical low or a logical high. The exact voltage of each will depend on the system that's being used; on the Omega, logical low is 0V and logical high is about 3.3V.

// TO DO: IMAGE: descriptive image showing 0V and 3.3V outputs

// TO DO: a sentence or two about how this can be used to control circuits

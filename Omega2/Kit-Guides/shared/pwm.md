### Pulse Width Modulation

Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) is a technique of producing varying analog signals from a digital source. Analog signals vary within a range by definition - not just a binary state as digital output would be. PWM is the simplest technique to deliver this kind of signal. It works by pulsing a digital signal and using the percentage of time the signal is 'HIGH' as the analog output. This means the average voltage output can be dynamically changed even if the voltage at any given instant is still only 'HIGH' or 'LOW'. There are some limitations to this method, but it's very cheap to produce and has solid performance within its operating range.

>For the curious, PWM actually converts a binary **voltage** signal into an analog **current** signal.

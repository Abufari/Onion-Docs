### The Buzzer

A buzzer can be described as audio signaling device, an alternative way to describe it is an annoying sound device. It has two pins and if we connect the positive (marked with +) end to power and the other end (negative) to the ground through a current limiting resistor, it will make a (potentially annoying) buzzing sound. The buzzer which is included in our kit is electromagnetic: it uses electromagnetism to generate repetitive mechanical motion which creates the buzzing sound.

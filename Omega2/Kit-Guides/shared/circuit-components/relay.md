### Relay Switch {#circuit-components-relay-switch}

A relay switch is a mechanical switch that is triggered electronically.

The relay we'll be using is on the Relay Expansion. It has two channels, channel `0` on the side away from the header pins, and channel `1` on the near side. Whenever we use the relay in a circuit diagram, it will be labelled with the exact channel number we'll be using.

// TODO: IMAGE of the relay expansion if it's not included elsewhere

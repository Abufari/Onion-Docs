### Devices {#circuit-components-device-pin}

This symbol is used to denote the pins on devices like the keypad and seven segment display that don't have 'official' symbols, but still need connections to and from.

These pins will always be labelled with the device that they represent. The pins themselves **may not be laid out the same** as the device's pins, but all pins will be present.

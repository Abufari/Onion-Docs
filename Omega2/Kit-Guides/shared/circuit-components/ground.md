### Ground {#circuit-components-ground}

The ground is the point of lowest energy in our circuit, all current will try to flow toward ground.

The ground is a single terminal symbol, and usually implies the GND pin on a Dock. In the circuits we'll build, we will also make good use of the breadboards rails to connect many things to the same ground.

### Photoresistor {#circuit-component-photoresistor}

A photoresistor is a sensor that converts the light it recieves to a varying resistance.

A photo resistor has two non-polar terminals. Its resistance changes depending on the light received by its face. It can be used in a voltage divider to convert the changing resistance into a changing voltage signal.

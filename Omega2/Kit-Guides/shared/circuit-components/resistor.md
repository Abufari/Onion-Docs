### Resistor {#circuit-components-resistor}

<!-- // super brief description of a resistor -->

A resistor is a circuit element that converts electrical energy to heat.

// another blurb about the resistor:
//	* two terminals

//		* resistances greater than 1000Ω are referred to by kilo-Ohms (kΩ), 1000Ω = 1kΩ

Resistors have two non-polar terminals - meaning orientation doesn't matter. The resistance across the terminals of a resistor is always within some percentage of the labelled value. Resistance is a measure of th ability of the resistor to convert electrical energy to heat. It's unit is Ohms (Ω). The greater the Ohms, the more energy the resistor will siphon. The Ohm is an SI unit, so the 'k' (for kilo) prefix is used for numbers greater than 1000.

1000Ω = 1kΩ

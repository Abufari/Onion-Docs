### Integrated Chip (IC) {#circuit-components-integrated-circuit}

An integrated circuit (IC) is a small circuit built to be a modular component of larger circuits, with pins in and out depending on the layout of the circuit inside.

The integrate circuit can have many terminals. In our experiements that use ICs, we'll go into more detail the purpose of the chip and what inputs and outputs are available.

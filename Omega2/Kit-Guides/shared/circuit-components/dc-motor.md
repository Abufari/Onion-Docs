### DC Motor {#circuit-components-dc-motor}

The DC motor is the simplest of motors, it converts electrical energy to mechanical energy.

The DC motor has two terminals that are technically polar. The direction of the current flowing through the terminals will determine the direction of the motor's spin - connecting the anode to a voltage source will generally spin the motor clockwise. Different motors may behave differently.

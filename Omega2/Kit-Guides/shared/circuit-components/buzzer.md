### Buzzer {#circuit-components-buzzer}

A buzzer buzzes when provided with power - it's uncomplicated.

The buzzer has two terminals with polarity. When the anode (+) is connected to a power source, and the cathode grounded to the same source, it will start making noise. Like most components, buzzers do not regulate the power they're supplied. This means a current-limiting resistor should always be used in a buzzer circuit.

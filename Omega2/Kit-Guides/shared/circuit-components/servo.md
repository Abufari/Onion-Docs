A servo is a motor that is controlled to produce fine and repeatable movement

Servos normally have three terminals - a power (`Vcc`) line, a signal (`SIG`) input, and a ground (`GND`) connection. These terminals are usually bundled in a single output cable ending in three female jumper connections. The signals accepted are most commonly a 50Hz pulse-width modulated (PWM) signal.

### Push Button Switch {#circuit-components-spst}

The push button switch is a single pole, single throw switch with four terminal pins switching one input to one output.

The push button switch has four terminals, connected to either side of the switch in pairs. Each pair is connected to each other, so the switch closes a single gap in the circuit. The 'single pole' refers to the single output connected to the two pins, while the 'single throw' refers to the single input connected to the other pair of pins.

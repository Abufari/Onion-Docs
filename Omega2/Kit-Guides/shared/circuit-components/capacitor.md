### Capacitor {#circuit-components-capacitor}

A capacitor is a component that blocks quick changes in voltage, but transmits constant voltages.

The capacitors in our kit have two non-polar terminals. They are used when we need to smooth out places where voltages can change rapidly. A capacitor's ability to smooth out voltages is called its capacitance and is measured in Farads (F). Unfortunately Farads are not well scaled - 1F is a huge amount of capacitance. In these experiments we'll be working with 0.0000001 Farads, or 100 nano Farads (nF). 

Outside of our experiments, capacitors are found in filtering circuits making sure signals are sent correctly, without chatter.

### Trimmer Potentiometer {#circuit-components-trimpot}

Commonly referred to as a 'trimpot', the trimmer potentiometer is an adjustable resistor.

The trimpot has three terminals. Two of them keep the same resistance value relative to each other - these are usually placed at opposing ends. The third (usually middle) terminal is adjustable by hand through the tuner knob. When the knob is turned, the resistance between the middle terminal and the two other terminals change - one side increases while the other decreases.

This creates an adjustable voltage divider that can be used to send signals to be read and acted on.

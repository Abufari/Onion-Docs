### Light Emitting Diode {#circuit-components-led}

An LED is a component which lights up when powered.

Each LED has two terminals, denoted in the symbol as the flat and pointy ends of the triangle. This is because the LED is **polar** and the direction that it is oriented matters. The flat end is the 'anode' (+) and the pointy end is the 'cathode' (-), the triangle should always point toward ground, wherever it is.

### How H-briges Work

An H bridge is a circuit that allows voltages to be applied across a load in either direction. At the core of an H-Bridge are 4 switches, 2 in series and 2 in parallel with each other, with the load placed in between the switches. In this configuration the circuit takes an "H" shape.

### Usages

H-Bridges allow AC Voltages to be constructed from an DC source. They allow loads to be powered independantly from the control signals that are controlling them, providing circuit isolation.

H-bridges provide the ability to reverse current across a DC motor allowing for bi-directional rotation.

H-bridges typically have 6 pins. 2 supply pins for the load and 4 control pins for each of the transistor switches.

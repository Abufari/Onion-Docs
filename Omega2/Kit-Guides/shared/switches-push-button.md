### Push Button Switches

A push button is a momentary switch, so unlike a slide switch where the change in the switch state will be permanent, the change in a push button's state will only last while the button is being pressed.

Push Button switches fall into the SPST category of switches, with SPST standing for Single Pole Single throw. This type of switch has two terminals with the switch controlling whether the connection between the two terminals is open or closed, which translates into turning the circuit off or on.

The buttons on TV remotes are all momentary push button type switches, so expect the same type of functionality (changing settings) with push buttons in our experiments and projects.

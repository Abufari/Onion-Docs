### Breadboard

The breadboard is the foundation of all of the experiments we're going to do together, and the starting-point for prototyping many electronics projects and even products!

The breadboard's sockets are connected to pieces of metal inside that are directly electrically connected (or "shorted") to each other in a way to make it easy for you to build and prototype circuits.

The vertical columns labelled `+` and `-` that run along the sides of the breadboard are called the **power rails**. The sockets in each rail are shorted **vertically**. The `+` rail is commonly used for Vcc or power connections, and the `-` rail is typically used for ground.

The sockets on the left and right side of the gap in the middle are called the **terminal rows**. In each row, the sockets marked `a` through `e` are shorted **horizontally** to each other, and same goes for the sockets `f` through `j`. When plugging integrating circuits (ICs) into the board, this lets you connect up to 4 wires per pin.

### Breadboard

The breadboard is the foundation of all of the experiments we're going to do together, and the starting-point for prototyping many electronics projects and even products!

The breadboard's sockets are connected electrically in a pretty logical way. The power rails, the vertical columns labelled `+` and `-` that run along the sides of the breadboard are connected vertically. While the terminal rows, labeled with numbers, are connected horizontally on each side of the middle channel. Meaning that for row 1, columns `a` through `e` are connected together, and columns `f` through `j` are connected together.

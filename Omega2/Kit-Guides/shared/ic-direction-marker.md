#### IC Direction Indicator

Integrated circuits (ICs) such as shift registers and H-bridges can come in **dual in-line packaging** with little metal legs for pins. It is crucial that ICs are plugged in right-side-up, so to avoid connecting them upside-down, they typically have a small semi-circle indentation on one of the ends that indicates "up".

Diagrams that show which pin does what (known as "pinout diagrams") will also typically show this marker so that you can always tell which pin is which.

Before you plug in an IC, make sure that this marker is towards the top of the breadboard. Otherwise, the instructions might be misinterpreted and pins will be connected to places they shouldn't be!

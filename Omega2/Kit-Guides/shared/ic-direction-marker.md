#### IC Direction Indicator

Integrated circuits (ICs) such as shift registers and H-bridges can come in **dual in-line packaging** with little metal legs for pins. It is crucial that ICs are plugged in right-side-up, so to avoid connecting them upside-down, they typically have a small semi-circle indentation on one of the ends that indicates "up".

Before you plug in an IC, make sure that this marker is towards the top of the breadboard. Make sure it's connected properly!

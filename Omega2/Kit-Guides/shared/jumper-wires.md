### Jumper Wires {#jumper-wires}

We'll be using jumper wires in all of our experiments and projects. They all work the same; connecting two points in a circuit together.

Jumper wires have ends that are either male or female. They both do the same thing, but the different ends make them work better in different situations. 

Male ends are used to connect inputs and outputs that are enclosed in sockets - breadboards and the pins on the expansion docks are examples of where you'd need male jumper ends.

Female ends are able to connect to inputs and outputs that are true pins, for example on the [PWM expansion](#pwm-expansion), every wire that needs to be plugged into the PWM channels require a female end to work.

Depending on your needs, you can plug jumpers male to female to create longer jumpers, or to replace missing jumpers of a specific kind.

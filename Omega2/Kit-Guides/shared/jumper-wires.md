### Jumper Wires

We'll be using jumper wires in all of our experiments and projects. They all work the same; connecting two points in a circuit together.

// TODO: IMAGE: showing several different jumper wires

Jumper wires have ends that are either male or female. They both do the same thing, but the different ends make them work better in different situations. More on that later, for now we'll be using jumper wires with male ends.

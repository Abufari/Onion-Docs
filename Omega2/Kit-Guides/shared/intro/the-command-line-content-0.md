The Omega's operating system (OS) is based on Linux, a popular open-source OS that powers servers and computers all over the world. The version on the Omega is a minimalistic and lightweight distribution called LEDE, which stands for **Linux Embedded Development Environment**. It supports many programming languages and and can run all kinds of complex projects while still being small enough to fit in the Omega's memory.

### The Command Line Interface

We interact and operate the Omega by using the **command line interface** (CLI). The CLI is the userâ€™s access point into the operating system using a text-based terminal program. All user interaction is interpreted and executed by the OS through instructions, or **commands**. A user enters a command into a terminal to make something happen.

The CLI can look something like the picture below. In this terminal program on Windows, the green box is where the commands you type will be displayed on the screen.

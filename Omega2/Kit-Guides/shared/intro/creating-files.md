## File Editing on the Omega

<!--
// this article is a description of how we're going to use `vi` to write the code we need for the experiments

// intro to article:
//	* the experiments we're going to do involve writing Python scripts
//	* here we'll learn how to write scripts using the command line
//	* we'll be using the Vi text editor
-->

In this Guide, there will be many experiments that make use of Python and Shell scripts. To get these scripts to run, we store the program code on the Omega as a file.

On the Omega, there's only one text editor installed by default - `vim`. It's different from more familiar editors in how it works, so we'll cover the basics super quickly before we move on to making cool things faster!

Nearly all of our experiments will use a circuit diagram to precisely express the circuit that will be built. Also referred to as schematics, or circuit schematics, we use them as an additional way to ensure we're on the right track. Beyond that, learning how to read them is a very useful skill for all kinds of electrical projects down the line!

This article is intended to be used as a reference when reading circuit diagrams, keep it bookmarked somewhere handy if you think you'll check back!

### General Structure
<!--
// show an example circuit diagram, briefly cover the following:
//	* the lines mean connections
//	* the various symbols mean different components
//		* the components are usually labelled with values
-->

Generally, circuit diagrams look a little like this:

This is a circuit from one of our experiments, and it follows the gist of a circuit diagram: lines connecting symbols.

In a circuit diagram, any straight lines mean an electrical connection between things - no matter through a jumper, a wire, or a big metal plate, as long as electricity can flow. The various symbols represent the components that are being connected by the wires. We'll cover the meaning of each symbol in detail below.

<!-- // NOTE: when describing the commands, we can lift from our existing article: https://docs.onion.io/omega2-docs/exploring-the-file-system.html
//	let's just make this more concise! -->

<!-- // intro:
// * describe how the Omega's OS is linux, but a minimalistic version, the way we interface with the Omega is through the command line interface (looking for a super compact version of our linux intro series, but to servo as an intro to this article, https://docs.onion.io/omega2-docs/linux-for-omega-beginners.html ) -->

The Omega's operating system (OS) is based on Linux, a popular open-source OS that powers servers and computers all over the world. The version on the Omega is a minimalistic and lightweight distribution called LEDE, which stands for **Linux Embedded Development Environment**. It supports many programming languages and and can run all kinds of complex projects while still being small enough to fit in the Omega's memory.

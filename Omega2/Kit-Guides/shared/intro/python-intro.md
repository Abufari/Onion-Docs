## Intro to Python

<!--
// brief intro:
//	* all of the experiments in this kit will use Python
// 	* python is a high-level, object oriented programming language
//	* it is an interpreted programming language, meaning the code doesn't have to be compiled (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpreted_language for details but DON'T JUST RIP IT OFF)
-->

Python is the language of choice for the experiments we'll be running with the Kits. As an introduction, this article will cover some of the basics so we can hit the ground running!

Python is a high-level, interpreted language designed for scripting. It supports Object Oriented Programming - which is a handy framework that we'll be covering in our experiments.

The high-level part means that Python reads closer to English than machine language. The interpreted part means that Python code is translated line-by-line by the computer as it's being run - as opposed to languages like C where it is translated first before it can be run.

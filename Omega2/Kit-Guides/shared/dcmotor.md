### How DC Motors Work

The simplest of all motors, DC motors turn when a DC voltage is applied across it. The rpm is determined by the current through the motor. Reversing the applied voltage, reverses the rotation of the motor shaft. 

The DC motor uses the uses a magnetic field generated by the by an electromagnet to turn the armature of a motor.

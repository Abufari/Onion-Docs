### How DC Motors Work

// TODO: this was phoned in, make it exciting

The simplest of all motors, DC motors turn when a DC voltage is applied across it. The speed of the motor, usually measured in Revolutions Per Minute (RPM), is determined by the current through the motor.

//TODO: expand on this
The DC motor uses the uses a magnetic field generated by the by an electromagnet to turn the armature of a motor.

// TODO: note this addition, expand on it/prettify it
To get the motor to spin the other way, we need to reverse the applied voltage, meaning the flow  of current through the motor will be reversed.
// TODO: talk about:
// 	* the motor can be damaged if current is applied to both terminals at once
//	* it's not easy for a host processor to just switch around the current since the processors usually run on lower voltages and are not directly connected to motors
//	* if only there were a device that could help ensure we're correctly providing power to our DC motors...

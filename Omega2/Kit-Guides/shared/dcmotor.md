### How DC Motors Work

<!-- // DONE: this was phoned in, make it exciting -->

The simplest of all motors, DC motors turn when a DC voltage is applied across it. This kind of motor can be found in drones, power tools, and robots. A DC motor can change speend and direction depending on how much power is fed to it and in which direction.

<!-- // DONE: expand on this -->
The DC motor uses the uses a magnetic field generated by the by an electromagnet to turn the armature of a motor. The electromagnet is activated by applying voltage, so when the power is on, the magnetic field it generates will cause the armature (a coil of wire) to generate its own nagmetic field, these fields push eachother away and cause the armature to spin.

<!-- // DONE: note this addition, expand on it/prettify it -->
To get the motor to spin the other way, we need to reverse the applied voltage, meaning the flow of current through the motor will be reversed. Unfortunately switching the direction of current from a controller like the Omega is difficult. The processors use low current and voltages, plus they are usually disconnected from the motor to prevent inductive feedback distrupting their operation.

If only there was some kind of device that can help us control the power we supply to our DC motors...

>Note that applying current to both terminals can cause damage to the motor.

<!--
// TODO: talk about:
// 	* the motor can be damaged if current is applied to both terminals at once
//	* it's not easy for a host processor to just switch around the current since the processors usually run on lower voltages and are not directly connected to motors
//	* if only there were a device that could help ensure we're correctly providing power to our DC motors...

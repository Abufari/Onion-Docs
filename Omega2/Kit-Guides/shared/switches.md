### Switches

Using a switch, you can turn a circuit on and off. What the switch is really doing is closing and opening the circuit.

An open circuit means there is a gap in the circuit, so current from the power supply cannot flow around the circuit and anything connected to the circuit will be **off**. When you turn off a lamp, you are opening the circuit; no more current flows to the lightbulb and it stops emitting light.

In a closed circuit, the circuit has no gaps and current can flow freely, any connected component will be received current and will be **on**. Going back to our lamp, when you switch it on, you are closing the circuit; allowing current to flow to the lightbulb so it can light up your space.

## Reporting Issues {#reporting-issues}

While we've done our best to make sure everything in this project book is 100% correct, it's possible that we've made mistakes, typos, or left stuff out. We would also love to hear any comments or suggestions you have!

If you find anything amiss with the project tutorials, please let us know by [creating an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/OnionIoT/Onion-Docs/issues).

If you find a problem in the code of a project, all projects have their own GitHub repository, please create an issue on the corresponding repository.

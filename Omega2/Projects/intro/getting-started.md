## Getting Started {#getting-started}

![Onion Shipment Box](./img/unbox-0-in-box.jpg)

Just got your Omega and wondering how exactly to get to making IoT things? Go through our [Get Started Guide](https://onion.io/getstarted) and you'll learn and accomplish the following:

* Properly connecting the Omega to a Dock and providing power
* Learning your Omega's unique name (it's just `Omega-` and the four bolded hex digits on the Omega's cover)
* Connecting the Omega to your WiFi network
* Update the Omega to the latest firmware

Then you'll be ready to start on the projects!

If you're curious, here's some more recommended reading:

* [Connecting to the Omega's Command Line](https://docs.onion.io/omega2-docs/connecting-to-the-omega-terminal.html)
* [Using the Console, the Omega's web-based virtual desktop](https://docs.onion.io/omega2-docs/the-console.html)
* [An overview of all of the Onion hardware](https://docs.onion.io/omega2-docs/hardware-overview.html)

If you're excited to get building, go on ahead. Remember to go back to the [Onion Documentation](https://docs.onion.io) if you're looking for clarification on how something works!

## File Editing on the Omega

The projects are based on code, which live in files, so it stands to reason that we'll be doing some file editing for each of our projects.

On the Omega, there’s one text editor by default - Vim. It’s different from more familiar, visual editors in how it works, so we’ll cover the basics super quickly to get to making cool things faster!

## Intro to Python

Python is the programming language of choice for this project book since its powerful, flexible, and generally easy to use.

## Internet Lock
 
Keys are so last year. With the internet, we can unlock things with our keyboard!

### Overview

**Skill Level:** Intermediate

**Time Required:** 1 hour

<!-- // go into some detail here about how we're going to be implementing the project //	eg. which programming language we'll be using, APIs //	include links to any api or module references -->

To accomplish this, we'll run a local HTTP server on the Omega to listen for the unlock signal. When it's set up, we'll be able to to unlock by accessing a web page through a phone, a laptop, or a kerosene powered toaster.

### Ingredients

<!-- // a numbered list of all physical items used to make this project -->
<!-- //	all items should be linked to a place online where they can be bought -->
<!-- //	the Onion items should be linked to their corresponding Onion store page -->

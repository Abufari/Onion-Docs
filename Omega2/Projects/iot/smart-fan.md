## Temperature Sensing Smart Fan

<!-- // brief intro to the project -->

<!-- // include a photo of the final result -->

Mornings too cold, but gets too hot by noon? By hooking up a temperature sensor to the Omega, we can use the data it provides to modulate the speed of a fan - cooling us down only when we need it!

<!-- // TODO: Add photo -->

### Overview

**Skill Level:** Intermediate ~ Advanced

**Time Required:** 40 Minutes

<!-- // go into some detail here about how we're going to be implementing the project //	eg. which programming language we'll be using, APIs //	include links to any api or module references -->

There's a lot of implementation details in this project that will change depend on the exact hardware you have access to. We used a D18B20 1Wire temperature sensor and a 3D printed fan + DC motor setup just like in the [Maker Kit tutorial](https://docs.onion.io/omega2-maker-kit/maker-kit-servo-h-bridge.html) since we had all of those handy. However, we recommend using a computer case fan as they're super common and fairly cheap.

To control the fan, we'll be using a python script and the Onion PWM Python Module to pulse the fan. We also use a library to operate the 1Wire sensor, but your mileage may vary depending on your sensor.

All the code we used can be found in the [iot-smart-fan repository](https://github.com/OnionIoT/iot-smart-fan) on GitHub.

### Step-by-Step

Follow these instructions to set this project up on your very own Omega!


#### 1. Prepare the ingredients

First let's get the Omega ready to go. if you haven't already, complete the [First Time Setup Guide](https://docs.onion.io/omega2-docs/first-time-setup.html) to connect your Omega to WiFi and update to the latest firmware. Plug in the PWM expansion to the Dock and grab all the components then move on to...


#### 2. Installing the software needed

We need Python and the Onion Expansion Modules to make this work:

```
opkg update
opkg install python-light pyPwmExp
```

Other modules we use we'll get from GitHub in a bit.

#### 3. Connect the fan

Computer case fans are voltage driven, but we can cheat by using PWM with a transistor to switch the supply voltage.

If you have jumpers handy, we recommend using them as a bridge between the header of the fan and the PWM expansion.

First we'll have to set up the transistor. For our lab setup, we used a STS8550 PNP transistor with a 2-wire PC case fan. If you use a different model, make sure to note which pin is the base/collector/emittor.

Most commonly, case fans have three pins/wires - one of which is a tachometer output. If you're using one of these, make sure there's no power being supplied to the output pin, this will cause damage to the fan.

>The output pin sends the current speed of the fan, it can be used in your code to check if the fan is working as a bonus!

We connected the power supply to the PWM expansion for cleaner wiring.

1. Connect the Signal pin from the PWM Expansion channel 0 (`S0`) to the base pin of the transistor (middle pin in the 8550)
1. Connect the `GND` from the fan to the collector pin on the transistor.
1. Connect the emittor pint from the transistor to any `GND` pin on the PWM Expansion
1. Finally, connect the `VDC` of the fan to the `Vcc` pin on the PWM Expansion

This circuit will now switch the Fan's voltage based on the PWM signal from channel 0

#### 4. Wire up the temperature sensor

This part is written assuming you're working with the D18B20, if your sensor is different, you may have to find a guide elsewhere on wiring it properly

>Note that the Omega does **not** have analog voltage reading capabilities - you'd have to use your own ADC if your sensor is analog!

The D18B20 has a pinout that looks like this:

![TMP36 Temperature Sensor Pin Layout](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OnionIoT/Onion-Docs/master/Omega2/Kit-Guides/img/DS18B20-pin-layout.png)

**NOTE**: the second graphic is a **bottom** view, where the pins are pointing towards you (we may have fried a sensor by misreading this one).

You'll need to grab your breadboard and plug the sensor into three different columns. The resistor will bridge the `VDD` and `DQ` lines, so plug that between the two columns like this:

<!-- // TODO: temp-sensor circuit -->
![temperature sensor wired](./img/smart-fan-sensor-circuit.jpg)

Now we can connect the sensor to the Expansion Headers.

* First, connect the `GND` pin of the sensor to a `GND` pin on the Expansion Header of your Dock
* Next, connect the middle pin (`DQ`) to GPIO1 on the Expansion Header
* Finally, connect the `VDD` pin to a `3.3V` pin on the Expansion Header


#### 5. Write the code

Head over to the [iot-smart-fan repository](https://github.com/OnionIoT/iot-smart-fan) on GitHub, and download the repo.

Here's where you'll have to do some editing of the code if you're using a computer case fan. Instead of the three PWM channels used by the H-bridge, the case fan will use only a single PWM as signal. 

##### Temperature Sensor

There's a good bit of setup for the temperature sensor - initialization, communicating, and parsing. If you have a different sensor than the the one given, you'd have to edit the setup lines (between `SENSOR SETUP BEGIN` and `SENSOR SETUP END`) to ensure it sends and recieves data correctly.
##### Case Fan

Open up `iotSmartFan.py` and change this line:

``` python
    motor = hBridgeMotor(H_BRIDGE_12EN_CHANNEL, H_BRIDGE_1A_CHANNEL, H_BRIDGE_2A_CHANNEL)
```

To this:

``` python
    motor = OmegaPwm(0)
```

And this line:

``` python
        motor.spinForward(duty)
```

To this:

``` python
        motor.setDutyCycle(duty)
```


#### 6. Calibrate and customize

By editing the `config.json`, you can change the output range of the fan and the temperature range to restrict the fan to. The fan is set to spin at a rate between the minimum and maximum duty. The output duty has a linear relationship with the temperature when it is between the min and max temperature.

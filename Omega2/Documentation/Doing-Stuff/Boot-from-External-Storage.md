## Booting from External Storage {#boot-from-external-storage}

<!-- // mention that, yes, flash storage on the Omega is limited, so it is possible to have the Omega boot from attached USB storage -->

The Omega comes with enough flash storage to get started and working on projects, but if you need more it's possible to extend the storage capacity using a USB drive or MicroSD card!

This article will explain and outline the procedure for the **pivot-overlay** process.

<!-- // base this on the existing article:
//  notes on this: find the different between pivot-root and pivot-overlay and then discuss them with Lazar, we will likely only choose one to inlcude in the article -->

### pivot-overlay

pivot-overlay allows you to download, store, and install software and packages onto another device such as a USB drive. The device can be as big or small as you need, so you'll (probably) never have to worry about running out of space again!

The technical explanation is that it mounts a storage device to the writable part of your filesystem, `/overlay`, which is merged with the read-only part of your filesystem, `/rom`, to generate the entire filesystem, `/`.

<!-- ### Boot Process

// include an illustration of how the omega currently works (boots from on-board flash)
// include an illustration of how it works when booting from USB storage -->

<!-- boot process shouldn't change for pivot-overlay only -->

### Requirements

You will need:

* A USB drive or MicroSD card with however much memory you need
* A Dock with a USB host port
* Firmware >= 0.1.9 b149
* Onion Console installed (so you can confirm that the storage space has increased)

Before you begin, you can see for yourself how much space is being used on your filesystem, and how much is available in the Settings app in the Console. Here's what it would look like by default on an Omega2:

### Important Warnings

Updating or reflashing the firmware will undo this process.

* All user-created files will be deleted. (this is a normal part of updating firmware)
* The filesystem will return to residing only on the Omega's onboard flash storage.

<!-- // remember to include the important caveats:
//  - updating the firmware might affect this (test this out and see what the outcome is) -->
<!-- //  - when the usb storage is removed, the omega will boot from the onboard flash and all of the filesystem changes made on the usb storage device will not be transferred (test this as well to find out exactly what happens) -->

And as always, **make sure your Omega has the latest firmware.**

**Before you continue, make sure all of your user code and binaries on the Omega are backed up somewhere!**

### Format Your Storage Device to `ext4`

>If you already have an `ext4` storage device prepped, you can continue with the next step.

**Formatting will erase *all data* on your USB drive. If you're reusing an old drive, make sure to back up your data before continuing!**

You will need a storage device formatted in `ext4`. If you don't have one that's formatted, you can format it using the Omega. 

First turn the Omega `OFF`, then plug in your USB drive or Micro SD card. This will save us an extra step of unmounting the drives before formatting.

#### Installing the Tools

Then on your Omega, install the necessary tools by running the following commands:

```
opkg update
opkg install kmod-usb-storage-extras e2fsprogs kmod-fs-ext4
opkg install block-mount
```

#### Formatting the Device

Now we're ready to format the device. We need to find the name under which our device is listed in `/dev`. By default, single-partition devices are listed as follows:

* USB: `/dev/sda1`
* MicroSD: `/dev/mmcblk0p1`

Run the following command and fill in your device's name:

```
mkfs.ext4 /dev/<device name>
```

It may warn you that the device contains a file system. Enter `y` to proceed.

For a USB device, the process should look something like this:

```
root@Omega-7ADD:/tmp/mounts# mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda1
mke2fs 1.43.3 (04-Sep-2016)
/dev/sda1 contains a vfat file system
Proceed anyway? (y,n) y
Creating filesystem with 3784448 4k blocks and 946560 inodes
Filesystem UUID: f5ca350a-d8e2-4334-8aa2-ee17d623c444
Superblock backups stored on blocks:
        32768, 98304, 163840, 229376, 294912, 819200, 884736, 1605632, 2654208

Allocating group tables: done
Writing inode tables: done
Creating journal (16384 blocks): done
Writing superblocks and filesystem accounting information: done
```

If you receive a message that looks like this:

```
/dev/sda1 is mounted; will not make a filesystem here!
```

Then the Omega may have automatically mounted your device for file input/output, which prevents us from formatting it. Read the section below to unmount your device.

#### Unmounting External Storage Device

**Do not perform this step if you were able to successfully format your storage device.**

By default, devices with a single partition are mounted to the following locations:

* USB: `/tmp/mounts/USB-A1`
* MicroSD: `/tmp/mounts/SD-P1`

>Devices with multiple partitions may have multiple entries, such as USB-A2, SD-P3, and so on.

Unmount the target device by running the following command, replacing `<mount path>` with one of the paths above:

```
umount <mount path>
```

### Mounting the External Storage Device

If you did not need to use the Omega to format your storage device, make sure the device is now connected to the Omega.

Run the following commands and fill in `<device name>` with your device's name (eg. `sda1`).

```
mkdir /mnt/<device name>
mount /dev/<device name> /mnt/<device name>
```

### Duplicating the `/overlay` Directory

Move the `/overlay` directory into the storage device that we just mounted by running the following command:

```
mount /dev/<device name> /mnt ; tar -C /overlay -cvf - . | tar -C /mnt -xf - ; umount /mnt
```

### Automatically Mount `/overlay` on Startup

Generate the `fstab` template using `block-mount`:

```
block detect > /etc/config/fstab
```

Then edit the `/etc/config/fstab` file to enable auto-mounting the `/overlay` directory:

```
vi /etc/config/fstab
```

Look for the line

```
option  target  '/mnt/<device name>'
```

and change it to:

```
option target '/overlay'
```

Then, look for the line: 

```
option  enabled '0'
```

and change it to 

```
option  enabled '1'
```

Save the file and restart the Omega:

```
reboot
```

And voil√†! Your Omega should automatically mount the `/overlay` directory. From this point on, all changes to your filesystem will be made on your USB storage device. This is what it should look like with a 16 GB USB drive:

### Booting Without the Storage Device Connected

**Caution:** If you power on the Omega without the storage device connected, the following will be unavailable or reset to default as they would have only been stored on the device:

* User-created files
* User-installed packages (eg. Python)
* Software settings stored outside of `/etc`

They will be accessible again once you reboot the Omega with the device connected.

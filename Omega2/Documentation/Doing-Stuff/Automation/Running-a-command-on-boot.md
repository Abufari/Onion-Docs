# Running a Command on a Schedule

// explain this article will show how to run a command on a defined schedule

// give an example for when this would be useful: for example, writing different things to the OLED at different times of day, or updating it with new information, think of something

// mention that we will be using the `cron` daemon to perform this task

## Explanation of cron
// make this title better

// small explanation of what a daemon is (running a program continuously in the background)

// explanation of how cron works - specifying a time interval and a command
// explanation of all of the cron rules - how to set differet time intervals in the cron file

### Text Output
// TODO: change the header title
// note that text output from the commands will not be saved anywhere by default
// introduce the concept of piping to a file

## Troubleshooting

// note the things that may stop the script from executing, if any

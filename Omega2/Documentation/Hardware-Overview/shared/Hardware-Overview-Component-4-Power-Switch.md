### Power Switch

<!-- [//]: # (inform them of what the power switch will do: cut power to the Omega but keep the USB to serial chip running) -->
<!-- [//]: # (TODO: have illustrations showing the ON and OFF positions) -->

The Power switch will cut power to the Omega, but not the serial chip. This means your computer will still detect a USB serial device, but will not be able to communicate with the Omega.

**Building the Circuit**

// regulator placement and identification of pins

// connecting the barrel jack with the regulator

**Provide Power to the Omega**

// jumping 3.3V and gnd to the Omega

Now that the

<!-- LAZAR: need to fix Omega LED in the firmware, when fixed, make sure to give time estimate for how long boot takes -->

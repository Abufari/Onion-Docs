**Some Computer Configuration**

Your computer may need some additional programs to access the Omega through a browser:

* If you are using Windows, install Apple's [Bonjour Service](https://support.apple.com/kb/DL999)
* If you are using OS X, you're all set to go
* If you are using Linux, the Zeroconf services should already be installed and you will be good to go

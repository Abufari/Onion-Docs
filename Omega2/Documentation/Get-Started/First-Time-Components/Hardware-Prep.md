Make sure your Omega's pins are fully plugged into the socket

**Provide Power**

The Omega itself is powered by a 3.3V source. But all Omega Docks have voltage regulators so you can use any microUSB to power the Dock and Omega.

<!-- TODO: ADD PHOTO: Plug a microUSB into your Omega -->

You can power it with your computer

Or you can power it with any wall adapter

<!-- TODO: include image of wall adapter -->

**Power On!**

Turn on the Omega using the switch.

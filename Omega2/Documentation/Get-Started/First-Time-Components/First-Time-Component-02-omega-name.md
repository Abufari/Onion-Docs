**The Omega's Name**

Let's find your Omega's name before going any further.

There's a sticker on the Omega's shielding:
![Omega2+](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OnionIoT/Onion-Docs/master/Omega2/Documentation/Get-Started/img/omega-name-0-just-omega.jpg)

The text printed here is the Omega's unique MAC address, we're interested in the last four digits that are in bold. **Your Omega's name is `Omega-ABCD` where `ABCD` are the last four digits from the sticker.**

So the Omega from the picture above is named `Omega-5931`

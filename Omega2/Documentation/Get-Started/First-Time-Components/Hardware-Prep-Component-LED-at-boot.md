The amber LED on your Omega should turn on and then start blinking after about 10 seconds. In about a minute, the LED will stop blinking and remain solid, this means that the Omega has completed its boot sequence!

*It's possible that your Omega will behave a little differently: if the amber LED on your Omega turns on and remains on, wait for about a minute, and your Omega will have booted.*

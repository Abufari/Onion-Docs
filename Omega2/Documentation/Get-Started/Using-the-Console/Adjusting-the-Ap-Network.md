## Adjusting the Omega's WiFi AP Network {#adjusting-omega-ap-network-using-console}

The `Wi-Fi AP Settings` tab in the Settings app is used to configure your Omega's access point.

On this page you can change your Omega's SSID, password, encryption type, and even the IP Address. You can also enable or disable the access point with the checkbox located at the top.

For more information on the Omega's WiFi and AP settings, check out this [guide to the Omega and Wireless](../../Doing-Stuff/Connectivity/The-Omega-and-Wireless)

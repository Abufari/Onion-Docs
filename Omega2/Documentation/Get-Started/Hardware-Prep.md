<!-- Prepare the Hardware -->

### Unboxing and Getting the Hardware Ready

**Unpack**

Unpack the Omega and Dock from their boxes

![Omega + Dock](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OnionIoT/Onion-Docs/master/Omega2/Documentation/Get-Started/img/unbox-1-omega-with-dock.jpg "Omega + Dock")

**Connect**

Plug the Omega into the socket on the Dock

Make sure your Omega's pins are fully plugged into the socket

**Provide Power**

The Omega itself is powered by a 3.3V source. But all Omega Docks have voltage regulators so you can use any microUSB to power the Dock and Omega.

<!-- ADD THIS: Plug a microUSB into your Omega -->

You can power it with your computer

Or you can power it with any wall adapter

**Power On!**

Turn on the Omega using the switch.

**Wait till it boots**

When the amber LED has been on for about a minute, your Omega will have booted.

*We're working on making this step more intuitive, stay tuned!*

<!-- LAZAR: need to fix Omega LED in the firmware, when fixed, make sure to give time estimate for how long boot takes -->

**Step 1: Download PuTTy**<br>
You can find PuTTy [here](http://www.putty.org/). Look for the `putty.exe` installer for Windows on intel x86. Once it's downloaded you can open and use it.

**Step 2: Establish a SSH connection**<br>
Configure an SSH connection to `omega-ABCD.local` on port `22`:

![putty ssh](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OnionIoT/Onion-Docs/master/Omega2/Documentation/Get-Started/img/connecting-windows-ssh-1.png)

Where `ABCD` is the unique id of your Omega.

**Step 3: Enter Credentials**<br>
Click Open and enter the credentials when prompted.

By default, the credentials are:<br>
Username: `root` <br>
Password: `onioneer`

**And you're connected!**

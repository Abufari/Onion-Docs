### PWM Signal Refresher

Pulse Width Modulated signals can be described with duty cycle percentages and frequencies/periods:

The **duty cycle** indicates what percentage of time a signal is on or high voltage.

The **frequency** determines the overall period of the pulse.

For a more detailed explanation, see the guide on [using the Servo Expansion.](../../Tutorials/Expansions/Using-the-Servo-Expansion#pwm-signals)


#### Channels on the Expansion

The PWM Expansion has 16 channels that can generate distinct PWM signals. Note that they will all be running on the same frequency.

## Finding your Omega's Unique Name

// TODO: make this sound nice

Each Omega has a name that is used to identify it and also is the default name of the Omega's AP. The name is based on the [MAC address](link to wikipedia article on mac addresses) of the Omega's wireless radio.
Each Omega2 has a unique MAC address

There's a sticker on the Omega's shielding:

[//]: # (Need image of production omega here)

The text printed here is the Omega's unique MAC address, we're interested in the last four digits that are in bold.

Your Omega's name is `Omega-ABCD` where `ABCD` are the last four digits from the sticker.

So the Omega from the picture above is named `Omega-296A`
